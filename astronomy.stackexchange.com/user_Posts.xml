  <row AcceptedAnswerId="338" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that all the possible posts that might use the [dust] tag will not necessarily be related to each other. Some will be FOD issues (a much more interesting tag, imo), some will be space debris, some will be dust during orbital operations, some will be dust on planets and other bodies. Having all these posts connected with a [dust] tag doesn't really help anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we separate this tag out into more useful categories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/3/2013:&lt;/strong&gt; Since I posted this question, two other questions have been tagged with the dust tag, and they have branched out into other areas as I predicted. Of the three questions that currently have the dust tag, one is space debris, one is orbital operations, and one is on the moon. These questions are not really connected to one another in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I recommend breaking the [dust] tag down into other tags. Here are my suggested tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fod&lt;/strong&gt; (This would refer to foreign object debris/damage during the construction and assembly of products.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cosmic-dust&lt;/strong&gt; (maybe, I'm not really certain that this is different than micro-meteorites)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dust-mitigation&lt;/strong&gt; (this addresses dust issues in orbital operations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;planetary-dust&lt;/strong&gt; (questions related to dust on planetary bodies, such as moon dust)&lt;/li&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;We currently have two tags directly relevant to your question and somewhat differentiating on &lt;strong&gt;dust origins&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt; and of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; that is perhaps really too broad and ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, we only have 3 questions tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; and 2 questions tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt;, so this might imply that breaking these more widely applicable tags further might be a bit premature, not to end up with more tags than we have questions for them, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions currently tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/1691/49&quot;&gt;Why didn&amp;#39;t the Apollo 11 lander blow the dust away? (or why does it look like it didn&amp;#39;t)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/1483/49&quot;&gt;How was dust-mitigation addressed during the Apollo program?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/1703/49&quot;&gt;Does cosmic dust pose a problem for long-term satellites, telescopes and probes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions currently tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/1480/49&quot;&gt;How hard is the Lunar surface?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/1721/49&quot;&gt;What is the average electrical charge on the lunar surface?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there are a few other questions, that could use at least one of the two, or possibly a new &lt;em&gt;dust&lt;/em&gt; related tag, and currently include none (granted, some questions have used up all the 5 available slots for tags and those might be better describing the nature of the questions, so think of this as a study into which additional tags we might need):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions that could use any &lt;em&gt;dust&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;micro particles&lt;/em&gt; related tag&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/14/49&quot;&gt;Is converting moon dust into oxygen a viable option for sustainability?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/231/49&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s the (particle) density of the asteroid belt?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/768/49&quot;&gt;Will Rosetta have to adjust its orbit around Chury due to the comet&amp;#39;s coma and tails?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is not to suggest these question need retagging, but so we get an overview of what possible additional or replacing tags the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; could be split into. I suggest we indeed get rid of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; tag and split it a bit into more descriptive tags, perhaps by the dust origins, and maybe find some other uses for them than merely the above listed questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt; (We already have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/planetary-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;planetary-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;planetary-dust&lt;/a&gt; could probably be added as a new tag synonym.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exosphere&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;exosphere&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;exosphere&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;New tag&lt;/strong&gt;. Could be used for any micro-density atmospheres where molecules and dust particles don't behave like gas and don't collide with each other so much as their movement being more influenced by inertia, sublimation, static and/or magnetic charge, including lunar exosphere, comet comas and tails, or surrounding any other celestials.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;space-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;space-dust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosmic-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cosmic-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cosmic-dust&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;New tags as synonyms&lt;/strong&gt;. Could be used for any micro particles in outer space, where its origin is not discussed.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clean-room&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;clean-room&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;clean-room&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;New tag&lt;/strong&gt;. For any questions regarding spacecraft assembly, foreign objects and mitigation thereof in clean room assembly environments.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, this is my suggestion for new tags that I believe could be added to already existing questions and as such immediately applicable. Instead of two that we already have, there could be four. Or putting it differently, one goes and three new ones are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of them could use additional tag synonyms, so posters can find them easier and add them to their questions on their own, but they would describe more or less the same thing. We also already have &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-debris&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;space-debris&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;space-debris&lt;/a&gt; (could probably do just as well without &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt; and be as such slightly more widely applicable), that doesn't really imply this debris size. Without &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt; in front of it, it could then also be used instead of your own suggestion to use the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fod&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;fod&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;fod&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;foreign object debris/damage&lt;/em&gt;) that is in my opinion not as intuitive and posters might fail to notice it to include it in their questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/s&gt; &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt;= &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/planetary-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;planetary-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;planetary-dust&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exosphere&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;exosphere&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;exosphere&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;space-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;space-dust&lt;/a&gt;= &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosmic-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cosmic-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cosmic-dust&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clean-room&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;clean-room&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;clean-room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-debris&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;space-debris&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;space-debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/s&gt;= &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/debris&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;debris&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;debris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit to add&lt;/strong&gt;: After a conversation with @JonEricson (our community manager), I'm inclined to rather not delete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; tag and make it another synonym of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt; tag. As has Jon pointed out, we might have problems getting rid of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; tag and it will be continuously added to our tag list by new questions, and if we keep it as a synonym, this way the authors of questions will be reminded of all the tags that have the keyword &quot;dust&quot; in them, as well as any synonyms it has, so also of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt; tag. So the slightly changed proposal for the tag housekeeping would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt;= &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/regolith&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;regolith&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt;= &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/planetary-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;planetary-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;planetary-dust&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exosphere&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;exosphere&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;exosphere&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;space-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;space-dust&lt;/a&gt;= &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosmic-dust&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cosmic-dust&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cosmic-dust&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clean-room&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;clean-room&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;clean-room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In view of suggested changes, please review your votes to support this proposal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, one of those close votes has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rory Alsop replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That's a good point @Hash - it works over there on Physics, but is a tad offtopic for space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This question is on-topic on Physics.SE, where it has already been answered &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Branson said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@RoryAlsop - Can you provide a link to the answer? [the Venus article on Physics.SE] doesn't answer this particular question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this Rory and Don talked some more and eventually came to agree that it was already answered. You can see the conversation on the original question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently though, there is not full agreement over two matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Is the question on-topic on Space Exploration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Has the question already been answered on the linked Physics.SE question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've posted this question because I am not entirely convinced in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, &lt;em&gt;at first glance&lt;/em&gt;, the question looks ok for our site because it is about terraforming. But I noticed that if you remove the word terraforming it looks like a physics question. The word terraforming really adds nothing to the way the question will be answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe it is a Physics.SE question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, I am not entirely satisfied that the question that is over at Physics.SE satisfactorally answers this question. The question at Physics.SE is about Venus particularly, while this question is about any planet (or even asteroid). Maybe that makes it too broad, but I don't know. PearsonArtPhoto's answer, while it uses the word Venus, seems more widely applicable. It seems that the question &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be answered in a broad sense, and maybe it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we migrate the question to Physics.SE where it can be answered? Or should we close it because it has already been answered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Point 1: Terraforming should be on topic here, so long as it's kept realistic. There have been many questions on the subject, and there doesn't seem to be a good reason to ban them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point 2: I'm not sure if I care. I've started &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/195916/155668&quot;&gt;a post on MSO&lt;/a&gt; asking about this question, what to do about unintentional cross posting, hopefully the community there will come up with an answer. Even giving that, I would say that it is not an exact duplicate. Bottom line is, it is my belief that we should ask questions on this site which we think are on topic here, and not worry about if the question has been asked/answered elsewhere. Linking to another SE post is okay, in the same way that linking to wikipedia is okay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was the Topic of the Week thread for 2013. The current thread is &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/452/topic-of-the-week-q1-2014&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please post new suggestions there!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that Stack Exchange in general has found effective is to devote a week to a specific topic in which members of the site feel is lacking. For instance, Arquade will frequently have a topic week to discuss a new game coming out, or Science Fiction and Fantasy will ask more questions about Star Wars. They encourage the entire membership to focus asking questions on a particular topic, often with the use of a single tag, especially if we feel like the site should be including more of those types of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on setting this up, at least for a while, for this site. Each Sunday, one of the mods will pick a highly voted answer to this question for which to select as the topic of the week. This will keep going as long as there is interest, both from the mods and the community as a whole. During that week, we encourage all of the active members to ask at least one question on that specific topic. Do research if you have to. In the end, we will be able to fill out this site, to include things which we don't have enough activity yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please give a single tag per question which you feel is underrated, and give an explanation of that tag to the group, so everyone can understand enough to start asking questions. Linking relevant Wikipedia articles can be of help, or other useful starting points for research. Finally, if you have a request for a specific week, then please include it in your answer. For instance, if there is a significant anniversary, a new launch, flyby, etc, then it seems logical we should have a topic of the week built around that subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics of the Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm a freshman in all this moderation &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt;, at least as far as Stack Exchange moderation goes. If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/298/49&quot;&gt;date when us pro tempore moderators were selected&lt;/a&gt; by the community managers, it has been only 48 days at the time of me writing this since appointment. That's the whole duration of my own experience in moderating any Stack Exchange website. The initial few weeks went fairly well, I dare say, then our ability to manage this website started being contested by my count three times worryingly enough, and with none of them (again, in my view) actually warranted, to prompt me to post this question. I would rather avoid being specific about which occurrences I have in mind, because that is not what I'd like to discuss here, but I have to say all this rather saddens me. And when you've yourself invested a lot of time and effort into making it all work, and for all of us, that comes as even more exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say it here, clear as daylight: All the time while being a moderator, I didn't see a single, not even the slightest indication that any of the other two moderators (@Chris and @PearsonArtPhoto) ever abused their position, or even overstepped the line of good moderation. The same goes also for our wonderful community moderators, with well deserved special mention of @JonEricson and @RobertCartaino, but a few others helped us out on occasion, too. In particular @AnnaLear during the &lt;em&gt;pre-moderator&lt;/em&gt; times. I would like to think that the same goes for me as well, but I'll let you be the judge of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where am I coming from? The idea of moderation is well explained in Jeff Atwood's blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;, but I would like to add to it that there is neither &lt;em&gt;&quot;me&quot;&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;&quot;i&quot;&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&quot;moderator&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. And that's exactly how I see all of us working here, doing the best we can and dedicating a lot of our own, non-paid time to iron out all the little wrinkles, raise questions in meta to discuss them if needed, and otherwise dedicate ourselves to the cause we're hopefully all purusing here, to hopefully make us all shine, be presentable for those that are yet to join us. All of which the very same idea that we together started this journey on, back from the Area 51 proposal for the majority of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've come a long way so far, all of it in a really short time, well before three months have passed since making it to private beta, then off to a public beta in almost a snap. All indications of the health of this site seem promising, and we're still gaining traction in the wider community of space exploration. I've also personally received a lot of praise of what we're doing here from all kinds of people, of all kinds of background. Yes, I'm actively promoting our cause. And so are other of your moderators. And the Stack Exchange stuff, too. But as our approval ratings are going up looking from the outside, I can't help but think that from the inside, from the very ones that we're together right from the start, exactly the inverse is happening. We're contested, doubts raised of our intentions or actions, and even worse is sometimes implied, albeit mostly indirectly. But the bitter taste is there, and I can't shake it off. I will need you to help me with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's my question. What do you, as a community member, think us moderators could do better, reassure you more of our intentions and that everything we do is on behalf of the community? Have we not met any of your expectations, or have promised something we're not keeping during the nomination and selection process? Then say it here, add suggestions for our improvement, or just state your request. We'll be glad to consider any suggestions to our betterment, as long as they're reasonable and not intrusive. Please keep it civil however, and discuss our position, not individuals in question. That's nothing any of us signed for anyway, neither you, nor us moderators. But rest assured that nothing of what you'll bring forth as be it a suggestion, or a remark will be held against you. We all have our superiors, and that goes just as well for all us moderators. Community, and that is all of you, comes first. I'm trying to build on some trust here, so let me be the first in trusting you to not abuse this thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you ever so kindly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not 'us'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All joking aside, you have done a great job, and I suspect that any controversy stems out of the fact that this site is doing so well. The more a community grows, the more moderators become &quot;the man&quot; keeping everyone down. Some won't see it this way, but some will--especially those who haven't moderated before or aren't used to active moderation on a site in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aircraft&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;aircraft&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, as it is currently used, a synonym of &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aerobot&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;aerobot&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;aerobot&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="411" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;All right, currently our biggest &quot;Needs Work&quot; area (in my opinion) is our questions per day. Our visits per day is also in the &quot;Needs Work&quot; but we are still a fairly young beta and we have been doing some promotion. Our questions per day is pretty bad though. Currently we have about 861 users, and a question rate of 4.9 questions per day. This means that on average each of us is only asking &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; one question every three months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to step it up. So if we want to get to the &quot;healthy beta&quot; metric of 15 questions per day, we're going to have to ask more questions. Each of us will need to ask about a question a month on average to meet this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a number of our users are probably inactive most of the time. That leaves it to the 83 of us who are avid users to really step it up. If we only count avid users, then 4.9 questions per day means that on average each of us is asking about 1 question every two weeks. &lt;strong&gt;In order to get to 15 questions per day, we need to be asking about 2 questions a week!&lt;/strong&gt; All of us who are over 200 reputation &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Top 20 rep users: Pearson, Tildal, Hash, Undo, AlanSE, Chris, Rory, James, Erik, ernestopheles, aramis, Mark, SF, Everyone, geoffc, coleopterist, horsh, gerrit, and Gwen --&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's assume that we do 25% of the contributions. That would mean that about 1.2 of the 4.9 questions per day come from us. That means that each of us asks about 1 question every two weeks. In order to get to 15 questions per day, our group needs to be at 3.75 questions per day. This also puts us at asking about 2 questions a week, so we are not exempt from the bolded value above.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with @Gerrit in the comments, we're not doing as bad as the question might suggest, especially given our current numbers. I would much rather see an increase in thought provoking questions than their sheer numbers, but we do need to &lt;em&gt;step it up&lt;/em&gt; a bit, I agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First about the A51 stats. Those are largely irrelevant at this stage we're currently in, because they appear to be sampling data from maybe two weeks worth of stats for the site (my guess, I'd have to ask), so if that is true, it's sampling from our &lt;em&gt;cruise mode&lt;/em&gt; telemetry and any reboost we manage to do with individual and more Stack Exchange popular questions will greatly affect these stats. What I'm saying is A51 stats show variations that aren't conclusive, let alone a good indication of our health. They are also not equipped with any metadata to enable them being read unbiased. It is just bad stats, if they lead you to any conclusions, which I don't believe is what they're there for. For example, if you simply divide the total number of our questions with the days since we've entered private beta, you'll know what I mean. That comes out as over 8 questions per day. They are, at best, means to somewhat (quantitative-wise) compare our last sample period activity with other sites that are at a similar stage of development. In that, they compare favorably for our site. So much about A51 stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, those stats (whichever you would look at) are still only relevant to the number of questions, not the quality of them or their answers. I.e. they are quantitative, not qualitative measurements or projections. I honestly don't expect us to ever deal with the sheer mass of questions that some other Stack Exchange sites do, because most our questions cannot be dismissed easily with a line or two and require some research to answer them. That is actually good even merely stats-wise, because it produces more SEO friendly threads with more highly specific and sought after keywords on web searches. Our web search stats confirm that and they are rising, and although I can't disclose more specifics about them, all the indications are we're doing just fine in that regard. I've already had web searches  where the top result would be one of our threads. That is great, but I honestly don't expect us to fill the whole first page of results at any time, and I would probably change my search provider if that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we do need to &lt;em&gt;step it up&lt;/em&gt; of course, nothing changed there since day one, but I couldn't really be asking more from those that are already highly active on the site, not in terms of asking more questions and disregarding their quality in the process at least. What we need to &lt;em&gt;step up&lt;/em&gt; is advertizing our presence to expert communities, gain a few more active experts that will help reassure casual visitors, by numbers main &lt;em&gt;consumers&lt;/em&gt; of our contents that these are good, quality contents that they can trust. We also need more experts and more answers per question. Saying it differently, we need more peer review, in Stack Exchange lingua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what I hope many of you are already trying to achieve, and we indeed have many threads in this meta suggesting how to go about it. I'm gonna quote myself from one of previous answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the share and favorite buttons under questions and answers&lt;/strong&gt;. Have you asked a question, or maybe answered it? Then share your contribution to social networks that you might have account at. If you don't have an account, they're easy enough to create. I personally find Twitter for this sharing most convenient, but I'm not saying it's the best overall. It's just what I'm most used to. Retweet (or re-share, whatever it is called on other social network websites) our main &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StackSpaceExp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Space Exploration tweets&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of who they were originally posted by. Favorite questions you like, both on social networks they are posted at and in the question threads themselves, and help us make a difference also in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackexchange.com/questions&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange SuperCollider&lt;/a&gt;, where - what we usually refer to as &lt;em&gt;rep train questions&lt;/em&gt; - can make a huge difference, greatly increasing our daily number of visitors. Sharing, favoriting, upvoting, adding answers and merely increasing page views by other means are the main contributors in raising their popularity and create a domino / cascade effect. We are competing with questions from other Stack Exchange websites there, and each of us can help the more popular questions reflect on our website's popularity in turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help make the questions themselves more visible to search engines&lt;/strong&gt;. Have you read the question and think it could use more tags, better worded title, it could have more external links (maybe to explain some used acronym better, preferably in words, too)? Then please edit it to be more search engine friendly and SEO (Search Engine Optimized). Can't submit edits directly, because you didn't reach the required privilege yet? No problem, suggest an edit, or raise a custom flag for moderators to handle it, explaining what you had in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote on contributions that you've read&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm not suggesting which way the vote should go, there should be both upvotes as well as downvotes warranted, and that is perfectly normal, if you look, even on already mature Stack Exchange sites. Good voting habits will help us further define what is on our website wanted, and what isn't. At the same time, it will make users posting great contributions feel more welcome, and are likely to stay more frequently with us. Plus, we need more members with higher reputation points privileges, so this feel of a productive community really starts happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participate in meta, and our main chat room&lt;/strong&gt;. Good ideas are always welcome in our meta site, but they do tend to add to our members' workloads where, as far as our statistics go, doesn't matter so much. Much of this red tape could be easily avoided by stopping by at our &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/9682/the-pod-bay&quot;&gt;main chat room&lt;/a&gt; and discuss smaller issues with our regular dwellers there. If ideas, suggestions, even arguments need to be kept on record, replied and voted on by our community though, then of course, by all means, please post it in our meta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help others learn the ropes&lt;/strong&gt;. Constructive criticism is fine, but often it will only take ever so slightly more effort in actually making some contribution better, than to comment on it. If you see a new, still low reputation user struggling to add links or images to their posts, then please edit them to include information they wanted to add, but yet can't. Also make sure they get those few much needed starting reputation points faster, so they can do a few of things on their own as fast as possible and start learning the ropes on their own. Many of our new members will actually already be used to handling stuff by having experience on other Stack Exchange websites, but some might be new. Lend them a hand. Ideally, the question titles and their tags should make as much sense before it reaches two upvotes and is automatically retweeted by our website's twitter account. So - edit for clarity, then upvote. If you see members struggle with some other things, help them out, or bring it to attention to our moderators and other members in our chat room, or with moderator flags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure your ideas to promote the site reach those that can help you&lt;/strong&gt;. Some members might be a bit more inventive, with a touch for designing our promotional materials, while some might be better at finding ideas that others could help materialize. Nobody here should feel alone in trying to promote our website, we have many users constantly dedicating some of their precious time for such activities, and we're already active in building our stack of promotional materials for use elsewhere. Best place to discuss such ideas is our main chat room, where you might get near instantaneous response, see how others feel about it. We certainly don't want to appear as too needy, desperate even, so be prepared for some criticism from our peers to polish some idea and really make it shine. It will make a difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help us upvote already placed on other sites community promotion banners&lt;/strong&gt;. As mentioned previously, these community promotion ads will compete with ads of other communities for their rotation space. Our currently placed ads are doing great, and have already attracted several dozens of visitors per each Stack Exchange website they're posted on to our website in mere days. The higher voted those ads are, the more frequently they will rotate on their respective main sites. These ads are posted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/364/49&quot;&gt;Ideas for off-site Space Exploration community promotion ads&lt;/a&gt; thread, listing in each answer where individual ads are posted and could use more upvotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't favor individuals, favor the whole community&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're here reading this, then you're likely already doing this, but just a quick reminder that other members need support from you as well, not just a handful of top rated members. The newcomers will likely need your attention more. If they write good contents, then make sure you've upvoted them. If you see them struggle with English or expert language, suggest an edit to improve their contributions. Try to add to their contributions, not hijack them. Avoid long discussions in the comments not to make them feel they're being tested, and rather invite them to our chat room. Have you been in our chat room and saw some new member come in and say nothing? Make them feel welcome and encourage them to participate in whichever discussion you're having. Be courteous. We already have much to show for, and some new members might feel unease inserting their own take. We want to prevent that and be an open society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on, and each of you reading this can probably think of other ways as well to help us kickstart the community to be more visible, more open and more inviting to new members. Share your thoughts here or in any similar thread how we might be able to achieve that, and don't wait for anyone else to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="420" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;The space program under the erstwhile &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; was highly decentralized. The Russian Federal Space Agency aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Roscosmos&lt;/a&gt; was constituted by presidential decree after the Russian Federation emerged from the USSR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, here on SpaceEx.SE, the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia&quot;&gt;'russia'&lt;/a&gt; was used originally. The tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/roscosmos&quot;&gt;'roscosmos'&lt;/a&gt; is a new entity. I started to apply the latter tag; then realized the tag-alternation may affect search-engine visibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should questions relating to &lt;strong&gt;pre-1992/Roscosmos&lt;/strong&gt; space missions be tagged 'russia', and &lt;strong&gt;post-1992/Roscosmos&lt;/strong&gt; space missions be tagged 'roscosmos'?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should all questions pertaining to space missions with a Russian/USSR affiliation &lt;strong&gt;carry both 'roscosmos', and 'russia' tags&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_versa#vice_versa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;v.v&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the event of the latter i.e. tag with both 'russia', and 'roscosmos', which takes precedence when the &lt;strong&gt;5-tag limit&lt;/strong&gt; is met?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should 'roscosmos' be &lt;strong&gt;deleted as redundant&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Roscosmos is not the only component of the Russian space program. As such, it is definitely not redundant. I suggest tagging the post with both &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;Roscosmos&quot; if you want to optimize visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil (AEB and others), India (ISRO), Iran, Japan (JAXA), China, and Canada (CSA) have really small space programs, and as such we don't get a lot of questions and answers about them here. However, these programs do have a number of operations, and I would like a week to focus on these developing space programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other developing space programs are also on topic, but I suggest we not include NASA (a given), ESA, or Russia's space program. These can be considered more established. Individual European space programs that collaborate with the ESA &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be on topic.&lt;/p&gt;

The choice is yours, but I assure you, nothing about it is sexist. We'll be exclusively rating the beauty of space exploration related hardware, not people or any other living beings, and the title is as such merely because I couldn't think of a better one at the time of writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rules&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One photograph of the sexiest piece of space exploration hardware that you can think of and was active (in use, operational) in 2013 per post, with attributed author and a link to the source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One paragraph photograph caption describing your case why you believe your submission should be nominated for the title of The Sexiest Space Exploration Hardware of 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may submit more than one nominee, each in their own new answer to this thread. No duplication of previous submissions allowed, even if your submission features a different photograph of the same hardware!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be appropriate. Posting photographs of indecently exposed pieces of space exploration hardware will result in immediate (&lt;em&gt;might take a while&lt;/em&gt;™) deletion of the submission in question, and possible other submissions by the same author will be mass-downvoted by all three active participants in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Space Exploration Meta&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highest voted submission by the end of the year (might be extended for a month, if required) wins the title of The Sexiest Space Exploration Hardware of 2013, is indicated so by accepting the answer, and might feature in future designs of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364/ideas-for-off-site-space-exploration-community-promotion-ads&quot;&gt;off-site Space Exploration community promotion ads&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;no promise&lt;/em&gt;™).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun, vote on those beautiful pieces of space exploration hardware that are / will be submitted, and brag to your friends how awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Space Exploration Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the winner is...&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of The Sexiest Space Exploration Hardware of 2013 goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/a/462/49&quot;&gt;ESA’s Swarm Constellation&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the competition date, the winning candidate received 8 upvotes by the pageant judging panel, consisting of all Space Exploration Stack Exchange members with the privilege to vote. Shared second place runner-ups are &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/a/471/49&quot;&gt;Voyager 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/a/468/49&quot;&gt;JPL's Opportunity aka Mars Exploration Rover - B (MER-B)&lt;/a&gt;, both receiving 4 upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition will not be extended for another month as no new entries were submitted in the last two weeks of the competition. This concludes our Sexiest Space Exploration Hardware of 2013 competition. Thanks go to all that submitted your entries and everyone that voted on them!

  <row AnswerCount="10" Body="&lt;p&gt;Infographics can be quite convenient sometimes, collating information from multiple sources and/or describing complex concepts in easy to understand and often visually pleasing way. Problem is, there is many of them and I find it difficult to remember where I saw some that I might later want to use as a reference, so I thought it couldn't go amiss to have a nice thread dedicated to them all of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in something specific that isn't yet posted below in the answers, then a Google Image Search with relevant keywords, adding &quot;infographic&quot; among them and filtering search results to display only large images, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=space%20exploration%20infographic&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbs=isz%3alt,islt:4mp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;q=space+exploration+infographic&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;isz:lt,islt:4mp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for images larger than 4 megapixels. Many space exploration infographics are also collected on various external pages, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JPL Infographics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.space.com/infographics/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Space.com Infographics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on, and links to more of them could be found by a &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; web search. Please post those infographics you find most interesting below, each in a new answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to post?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image files can be absolutely huge (poster-size), and since I expect we'll eventually add many and don't want to cause problems to those that are bandwidth starved, I propose we post here thumbnails that would link to wherever they're externally hosted, or if that external location is at risk of being changed or forgotten about (&quot;link rot&quot;), perhaps even better if we upload them here using image uploader, and then reuse their new location for the link for the thumbnail image. If you'll have problems with this, don't worry, I or someone else can edit your submissions for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post the best infographics that are space exploration related, preferably as thumbnails (or whatever size you deem befitting for the purpose of cataloging them here) that are linked to their poster size, or the highest resolution that they come in. If you can, also post short description of what they are supposed to represent, when they were last updated, and don't forget to include the link to your source. If you find some that you thought are good but aren't in English, then if you can translate them in the post, they should still be acceptable, and perhaps I even translate the image itself. As long as that's possible without utterly ruining its design, of course. That's it. Get cracking! :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infographic Date: April 12, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as there have been attempts at space exploration, animals have been involved. This infographic created by Karl Tate of Space.com shows the animals launched into space by different countries from 1947 to 1996 (with a brief mention of the Bion mission resuming in 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;I note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3332/how-long-is-the-aerodynamic-heating-during-reentry&quot;&gt;how long is the aerodynamic heating during reentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1835/do-solid-propellant-engine-needs-optimum-temperature&quot;&gt;do solid propellant engine needs optimum temperature&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3257/what-is-the-safe-temperature-range-of-spacecraft-propellant-storage-tanks&quot;&gt;what is the safe temperature range of spacecraft propellant storage tanks&lt;/a&gt; are all closed.  They seem neatly on topic to me, but my experience is mostly on math.stackexchange.  Yes, there are many different technologies involved, and the answers have a range depending on the technology, but I think a useful answer can be given.  For the first, OP had heard a figure of 15 seconds and asked if that was close.  It seems reasonable to me to look at a few mission profiles and extract a heating period to show that they are longer than 15 seconds.  For the second, I would guess the combustion process probably doesn't care much about propellant temperatures and it is more about other parts of the mission (o-rings, for example).  For the third, OP recognizes that there are a number of propellants, but a few sentences on cryo vs storable liquids, the temperature range of storables, etc. would seem useful.  Is the community view that these should be closed?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;To the first, saying merely that the figure of 15 seconds isn't exactly right does not really answer the OP's whole question and is not particularly useful to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second, your point actually highlights the lack of specificity in the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the third, a summary might be possible but would not be very useful in the context of safety that the OP raises in the question.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;second quarter 2014 Topic of The Week&lt;/strong&gt; thread, where we are gathering suggestions for which of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/tags&quot;&gt;main site tags&lt;/a&gt; should receive more attention and we should focus on providing more contents for them during the week they're featured. Old threads are here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/373/topic-of-the-week-h2-2013&quot;&gt;Second half 2013 ToTW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/452/49&quot;&gt;First quarter 2014 ToTW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be gathering suggestions for future ToTW roughly each quarter into a new thread to reduce clutter, as new suggestions in old threads tend to not attract as many votes being pushed on the page down low and barely visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules are still the same and simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each Sunday, one of the mods will pick a highly voted answer to this question for which to select as the topic of the week. This will keep going as long as there is interest, both from the mods and the community as a whole. During that week, we encourage all of the active members to ask at least one question on that specific topic. Do research if you have to. In the end, we will be able to fill out this site, to include things which we don't have enough activity yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please give a single tag per question which you feel is underrated, and give an explanation of that tag to the group, so everyone can understand enough to start asking questions. Linking relevant Wikipedia articles can be of help, or other useful starting points for research. Finally, if you have a request for a specific week, then please include it in your answer. For instance, if there is a significant anniversary, a new launch, flyby, etc, then it seems logical we should have a topic of the week built around that subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this thread becomes active, we'll change its title to reflect currently running ToTW and feature it, so it shows in our Community Bulletin (the yellow box to the right hand side   of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;main site&lt;/a&gt; pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few last selected ToTW to the list for easier reference (links on dates point to the suggestion), and we'll add new ones as they gather sufficient support by voting on them:&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Phil, it is not that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; questions requiring list answers are frowned against, but specifically those that contain indeterminately long lists or lists which are likely to change frequently with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our users are arguing that this is one such list. Frankly, I disagree, though I can see how it could become such a list eventually. I don't really think there is much you can do at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also seen some users arguing that this is trivial information that one might find on Wikipedia. If our community determines that to be the case, there is also not a lot you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the community decides to close your answer, I would encourage asking more questions. It can take time to pick up on the culture around here, but you will find that most people are welcoming and ready to help new folks who are eager to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me in the comments here or ask them in our chat room. Also, check out our help center if you haven't already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, here is what the SE staff told me about Community Wikis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to let you know that I un-wikified this question (Present distances between planet. How can I find them?), but I wanted to fill in a few blanks about why.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wiki has a long history of continued use where the use case is no longer needed... to the point where the entire feature has been largely deprecated. Since the concept of Community Wiki was created, we've added a lot of features that have almost completely negated the need for it at all. The best place to start is this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/&quot;&gt;The Future of Community Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Basically, we no longer use wiki as a broad rep-denial mechanism or when a question might become a list. Personally, I would have removed (or repurposed) the concept of Community Wiki on SE a long time ago, but it still has a really, really narrow use case when an answer is being used as a broad, collaborative repository that is constantly being updated by a lot of users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't worry too much about the &quot;make a list&quot; aspect of this question. This isn't quite the same as someone asking to compile a list of everyone's favorite blogs. This user is trying to solve a pretty specific problem where the answer just happens to be whether a tool exists to help him solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hypothetically speaking, if you suspect (or if it comes to pass) that the list of answers would become so long and boundless as to become completely unmanageable (or largely unvetted as folks lose interest in maintaining it), it would be fair to ask &quot;why wouldn't any random tool easily found work for you?&quot; If the list of answers is so impossibly broad that folks are only piling on and guessing what tool would help the original author specifically, the question should be narrowed down. That doesn't really seem to be the case here. This is the difference between a question saying &quot;let's create a big list&quot; versus someone asking &quot;can someone help solve my problem specifically?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;Yesterday there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/9328/4660&quot;&gt;a question&lt;/a&gt; about small commercial rocket motors for sale in the U.S.. I'm going to post an image of it in case it becomes inaccessible in a while due to deletion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nRf4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;what is the market for small liquid rocket motors&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TildalWave put it on hold on the grounds that there is a policy across SE against questions asking for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/&quot;&gt;shopping recommendation&lt;/a&gt;. The argument is that any answer becomes obsolete quickly, is highly dependent on the particular needs of the asker and as such is usually not useful to others, and that if recommendations were allowed, attempts at covert advertising through fake questions and answers would immediately appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question had been around for a number of hours when that happened, had received two answers, and nobody had noted the shopping issue and flagged, commented, or voted to close. In my case, I just wasn't aware of the entire issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi had answered with a brief relevant list and made the case the rule doesn't apply here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...I don't think it's fair to say that he's asking for a product
  recommendation. He's asking what companies manufacture these. Also,
  most of the arguments why product recommendation questions are bad do
  not apply to SE. Most of these thrusters were designed decades ago
  with minor upgrades (so why will they be obsolete next year?),
  personal preference is not much of an issue, prices are unavailable in
  any case, and he explained that he wanted US manufacturers first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly easy to see why it seems doubtful that vendors or buyers of spacecraft components would use Space.SE to boost sales, or would be influenced by opinions here. Or is that entirely true? One doesn't get the feeling the asker was actually about to buy a rocket motor, because if he was, it would be very strange if he didn't already know about the market. Is that going to apply to all commercial components at all times? Can it be handled case-by-case since it seems unlikely to come up more than rarely? Is it viable to make a complete list of all products to answer such questions and have confidence it won't become obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was enough debate on this occasion it seems to deserve examination. Since I am pretty neutral and also am trying to get used to how to handle all this kind of thing, I decided to do the asking.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Let's look at this question from a different angle than the shopping angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the parameters in the question, we're talking about the type of engine you would have on a model rocket not bound for space. That means this question is actually off topic because it is about model rockets, not space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what our Help Center says on what is on topic here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Space Exploration is primarily about spacecraft, how to send them to space, and their functions there. Specifically, questions on these topics are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Space exploration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satellite design and operation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systems with potential use in space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scientific discoveries made by space probes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;What topics can I ask about here? - Space Exploration Help Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the engines being asked about are not going to be used on a space-bound rocket, then we are not talking about spacecraft or systems with potential use in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, without even delving into the ambiguous &quot;shopping question&quot; issue, we can determine that this question is firmly off topic on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited to add:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commenter did point out this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/9328/what-is-the-market-for-small-liquid-rocket-motors-0-5-to-10-kn-thrust#comment25513_9359&quot;&gt;I think op's question was aimed towards the commercial side of things and not amateur rocketry. Maybe they could be used as an apogee kick motor or for attitude control on large spacecraft, though I could be guessing. –  Mardlamock N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the case that the use case of the engine was for some auxiliary purpose on a space-bound vehicle, then there is room for improvement in the question. The author would need to edit to make the question more specific.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="675" AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;This meeting is held every year by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lpi.usra.edu/leag/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LEAG&lt;/a&gt;, a division of NASA that oversees lunar exploration objectives. It is attended by the best in the area of lunar science and exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I am going in order to help out a speaker at the event with his talk (tech support and general promotion) and to look after the table we'll have for promoting his project (more promotion and general working of room). He is a director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nss.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Space Society&lt;/a&gt;. His agenda there is advancing the idea of declaring an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/leag2015/pdf/2055.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;International Lunar Decade&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2017, as a framework for increasing international collaboration on a return to the Moon. I recently established my own chapter of the NSS on a very similar theme - &lt;a href=&quot;http://moonwards.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moonwards&lt;/a&gt;. I work on Moonwards full-time. It is just starting out, but it is my job, period. So, I help him with his mission, and he helps me with mine. The NSS has generally been happy with my work so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone who reads this will have an idea what I think about the role of space.stackexchange in the future of space exploration. The area is on the verge of big changes. Getting momentum now in advocacy and support for the area puts one in a great position to catch the wave that is going to come along sometime in the next two years or so. SX.SE is in the right place at the right time. If SpaceX succeeds in reusing first stages, the whole field will go bonkers. Cubesats are developing in ways nobody expected, and that trend will accelerate. China's ambitions in space are big and one of these days they are going to do something that makes the rest of the world sit up and take notice. An announcement of big money pouring into the area will occur shortly before the LEAG meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who will be at the meeting know all this - except the part about SX.SE. What they need is someone to convince them that engaging the public at the grass-roots would really help them navigate the big changes coming. They need someone to talk to them about how much morale can be lifted at an agency struggling with budget cuts and uncertainty, by sharing knowledge and watching the unexpected ways that ripples outwards. They need it seeded in their minds how great SX.SE is for those things. It would be &lt;em&gt;awfully&lt;/em&gt; nice to have a few first-rate planetary scientists hanging around on the site, we have a bit of a gap there. And people going back to NASA, or ESA, or the Canadian Space Agency, and having a mug on their desk or a sticker in their cubicle, that is a nice, constant subliminal reminder. When traffic ticks up, we need the people here already, and experienced, to answer quickly and well. We need to recruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whatever happens, I'm going, and I'll chat up SX.SE. But, you know, if my costs could be defrayed a little, it would be easier to do this &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. I already have a couple of other reasons to do so, a nudge could make the difference. So please say what you think. If the community here thinks this is a good idea, Stack Exchange will help me out a little. I've already applied for swag to hand out, and I'm working with TildalWave on a t-shirt design based on the ads he made a while ago. I'll have a few made up, to raffle off, and to shove gleefully at any awesome planetary scientists I can get to take one. Anything else I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, the total budget of space science and exploration is still beyond that of a single crowdfunding project, but individual satellites or additional science missions for probes are good targets for crowdfunding initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can get public buy-in, you can open up a deep pocket of funding. What is critical, however, is that the public understand the mission. Like any stakeholder, the public will want to know what the details of the mission before contributing, but for the public to properly understand they need a forum to ask pertinent questions that a layman has when reading about space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Space Exploration Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;On a site like Space Exploration, it is often not so black and white that an answer is true/false. The issues we deal with are complicated and broad in scope, and sometimes we are dealing with situations where we don't even have all the data yet. All of these could be said to apply to the question you answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is often the case here, we usually expect an answer to be presented in a format that properly explains itself--otherwise it can be difficult to determine what exactly the answer &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, much less whether or not it is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often expect an answer to use references or explain their reasoning. We expect an answer to be structured so that the portion that actually answers the original post is made clear. Most importantly, we don't expect anyone to get it all right on the first shot, but we do expect them to work with the community (through comments, etc.) to refine the answer. That's what we have these tools for.&lt;/p&gt;

Doing so on their behalf is rarely a good use of one's time&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/5592&quot;&gt;Why does the International Space Station have a downward facing light?&lt;/a&gt; I can imagine that different people would respond to it in different ways. However I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/5596/12102&quot;&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt; is exemplary, and represents what attracted me to space exploration stackexchange in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@TildalWave used the first paragraph to survey the actual lights on the ISS and their function, treating the question with great respect. Next came this carefully selected &quot;aha!&quot;-inducing image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvnD0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvnD0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed by information on how big those arrays actually are such that the ISS can be seen from earth. The photo in &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/5608/12102&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; by @KimHolder is also really helpful, clarifying the difference between flares from the panels and the more ubiquitous reflections from everything else that's shiny. I liked this about space exploration stackexchange - that questions were treated with respect here, and looking through @TildalWave's voluminous, methodical and comprehensive answers I can see where this came from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stackexchange is &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerworld.com/article/2472047/cloud-computing/it-s-a-floor-wax-and-a-dessert-topping--hybrid-cloud-storage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;floor wax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;desert topping&lt;/a&gt;. While it is a depository of great answers - because of their intrinsic quality or because they actually the questioner's question or hopefully both - it is also a place to come and learn for both the knowledgeable and the newcomer. Sometimes the newcomer is new to more than just stackexchange. For those, a &quot;your question is welcome here&quot; feeling in the beginning can be really important to long term participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when a question like that gets one answer, and it is of the &quot;you shouldn't want to know the answer to your question&quot; followed by an answer to a different question that wasn't asked variety, it can be &lt;em&gt;unnecessarily&lt;/em&gt; disheartening. On other stackexchanges I have seen many rescues where the questioner got the answer that really helped them, and for which they thanked, specifically because a third party intervened to clarify the question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;you shouldn't want to know the answer to your question&quot; type of answer is not actually bullying, but it can be a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So my question is&lt;/strong&gt;: Is clarification of someone's question always solely 'up to the asker', even in situations where the asker may be new to the stackexchange environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to '&lt;em&gt;waste of (my) time&lt;/em&gt;', well that's definitely an answer to a question that wasn't asked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eerily, while I was typing this, a new answer appeared to the ISS question - here is a screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;You make some good points about treatment of new users which I try to give more grace myself. Stack Exchange is supposed to be built around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice&quot;&gt;Be nice&lt;/a&gt; model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whether you've come to ask questions, or to generously share what you know, remember that we’re all here to learn, together. Be welcoming and patient, especially with those who may not know everything you do. Oh, and bring your sense of humor. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That basically covers it. But these three guidelines may help:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rudeness and belittling language are not okay. Your tone should match the way you'd talk in person with someone you respect and whom you want to respect you. If you don't have time to say something politely, just leave it for someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be welcoming, be patient, and assume good intentions. Don't expect new users to know all the rules — they don't. And be patient while they learn. If you're here for help, make it as easy as possible for others to help you. Everyone here is volunteering, and no one responds well to demands for help.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don't be a jerk. These are just a few examples. If you see them, flag them:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Name-calling. Focus on the post, not the person. That includes terms that feel personal even when they're applied to posts (like &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;ignorant&quot;, or &quot;whiny&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bigotry of any kind. Language likely to offend or alienate individuals or groups based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc. will not be tolerated. At all. (Those are just a few examples; when in doubt, just don't.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inappropriate language or attention. Avoid vulgar terms and anything sexually suggestive. Also, this is not a dating site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Harassment and bullying. If you see a hostile interaction, flag it. If it keeps up, disengage — we'll handle it. If something needs staff attention, you can use the contact us link at the bottom of every page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We're proud to be a large, user-driven space on the internet where name-calling, harassment, and other online nastiness are almost non-existent. It's up to all of us to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In summary, have fun, and be good to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are sometimes situations that come up, that veteran users have seen a lot, that represent a fundamental lack of understanding of the way the site works, or seem to indicate a lack of regard for other people's time (by doing no prior research). The response to these situations are not always as kind as they perhaps should be at first. Ultimately, we need a lot of grace both ways. Many of these users are incredibly busy experts in the field who have invested their precious time to help build this site, and they don't always get polite responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unkind behavior is not justified either way, but just as we should expect grace to be extended to us, we should extend grace to others. We don't have a lot of name-calling or harassment around here, and when it comes up it is dealt with. We have a good community, though we may get caught into little disputes now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, about &quot;wasting time&quot;. First of all, Kim never mentioned wasting time. As you indicated in your first quote, she said &quot;rarely a good use of one's time&quot;. This may sound like I'm being needlessly pedantic, but there is a difference. Looking out to make sure the asker's post is handled well is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a waste of time; &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, it is true that when the asker does not edit their question when asked to clarify, progress will rarely be made. Also, the problem with your post is ultimately what you stated in your own words: &quot;So I don't know the answer to that&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were knowingly using the answer space to provide commentary which was not an answer. The appropriate place to discuss would have been in chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consider how microfractures in the X-33 composite tank killed that project.&lt;/em&gt; - no actual material discussion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plus 2 actual questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Are composites used by space programs?*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if we had a layer of graphene composite, custom-shaped to the size of the wearer?&lt;/em&gt; - sci-fi realm for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;composite materials&quot; is:question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 2 users asked 3 questions in total regarding these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a total of 5 questions where the tag would actually apply. Is that enough? I withhold my vote.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to understand procedurally what actually happened. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;No, comments are not always moved to chat. They can be deleted by moderators at any time for any reason. In this case, Kim removed them because they were obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, deleted comments are not permanently gone. Moderators have the ability to view these comments and even undelete them, though we can't undelete user-deleted comments.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I think it is a good idea. Since we can only put a maximum of five tags on each question, and (for now) search results are less than stellar, having specific tags could be helpful for finding relevant material. I'd estimate that if there are three questions to which a more specific tag would apply well, it should probably exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if people don't know to try those search terms, perhaps they don't help. Perhaps they can even hurt if they mean that more general search terms miss results that would have been helpful because the system doesn't realize that a specific tag is a sub-set of a more general tag. In this case, the word material is part of the tag, so this problem is avoided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the long term, in my opinion it is critical that SE develop a much better search system. It is unfortunate that tags don't seem to be nearly as useful as they could be. &lt;/p&gt;

The user who asked this question at our site was not the only one who was confused by the confusing statement in that video. (Google it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling that woo out as woo is the answer to the question. I most strongly object to the conversion of my answer to a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I disagree, calling out woo is a meta-objection, and thus is an appropriate concern to raise on Space Exploration Meta, not in answer to the question itself (comments may be a precursor to a meta discussion).

  <row AnswerCount="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of calculators, simulators, plotters, visualizers, and libraries of bits of code and models and such online. Many of us are aware of a bunch of them, and they are great learning tools and aids for projects of all kinds. So, in the spirit of other very popular posts here, I'd like to propose we collect a list of them and update it as new things are found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, like these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/249/4660&quot;&gt;Resources and references on the topic of space exploration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/472/4660&quot;&gt;Collection of space exploration related infographics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Resources and references list has a set of answers that split the material into sections, each of which is a community wiki (people collaborate to add material to the answer and the usual point system doesn't apply). That seems like it would be effective here too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started two answers, one for tools that can be used in a browser, and one for things that are downloaded for use. Possibly it would be useful to distinguish between free and for sale material too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All resources made available on this page are user-recommended. They have not been vetted by Stack Exchange or the moderators of this site. Use at your own risk. A disclaimer about RedShell analytics software (widely considered spyware) is posted on Kerbal Space Program (KSP) below. The presence of that disclaimer is not an indication that the other resources are clean. It exists only because the community was made aware of the issue in that instance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few years parts of the answer will be obsolete, and new missions will be come available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we handle such a moving target? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit a date in (into the title?), allowing it to 'settle down', maybe resulting in a follow-up question one year later...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't do anything, allow future edits to update the answer accordingly (strikethrough or delete obsolete items?)..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The year is rapidly coming to a close, which means even though we typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19478/the-many-memes-of-meta/268583#268583&quot;&gt;hate it&lt;/a&gt;, it’s time to have some fun...with hats!

  &lt;p&gt;Most of you remember previous years’ events, but here is a quick little reminder. Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The event will run from &lt;strong&gt;19 December 2016&lt;/strong&gt; up to and including &lt;strong&gt;08 January 2017&lt;/strong&gt;. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on &lt;a href=&quot;http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, &lt;strong&gt;at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...hats or no hats? We have until &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 13 December 2016&lt;/strong&gt; to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Muze, all Stack Exchange sites have moderators to supplement the community. A moderator has the ability to perform what we informally refer to as an &quot;insta-close&quot;, which immediately closes the question with only one close vote. The community has the ability to override this if they desire by voting to reopen. Many of our users may simply not have the time to read through your long question to see if it is worth closing, that is why we have moderators who volunteer to do this type of activity. For what it's worth, I fully support Kim's action, and I was about to send you a private message anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the moderators are audited by the Stack Exchange Community Team (who are employees of Stack Overflow), and if you have a complaint about a moderator action you can email the Community Team at community@stackexchange.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that this question was translated into English by my father, who is the one typing it. I'm eight years old and I don't use SE unsupervised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every question asked by this family probably doesn't need that sentence - I think it would get distracting. But the context that OP is eight years old is important when determining the level of detail to use in an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. I like the idea of having a set of questions folks can show their kids to get an extremely basic (but also accurate) intuition for a complex subject. After all, what little kid isn't fascinated by rocketry? Is this within our scope as a community? For the record, I think it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a quick look through the existing tags, but didn't find [basic] or [learning] or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about it? Do we get enough of this kind of question for a tag?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For anyone who might not know, the (half-joking) name in the title is a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1133/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this xkcd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm not necessarily opposed to my idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/simple-english&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;simple-english&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;simple-english&lt;/a&gt; tag for this purpose, but there is a potential problem I see with this concept. This tag would open us up to having &quot;simple&quot; duplicates of every question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/1858/58&quot;&gt;Is there any reason to send space probes along the plane of our solar system instead of perpendicular to the plane of our solar system?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In simple terms, is there any reason to send space probes along the plane of our solar system instead of perpendicular to the plane of our solar system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OP of the latter would say that it is not a duplicate because the second is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/simple-english&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;simple-english&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;simple-english&lt;/a&gt; question, while the first is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, this meta question is on the right site. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/tour&quot;&gt;Worldbuilding Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/universe-factory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/35626109#35626109&quot;&gt;it was suggested&lt;/a&gt; that we put together a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7642/full/nature21360.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the recent discovery of four more planets around TRAPPIST-1&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to try to write it up the next couple days, and we'll probably publish it in a couple weeks (though no promises).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also want to &lt;strike&gt;steal&lt;/strike&gt; take inspiration from content on Astronomy Stack Exchange about &lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/search?q=TRAPPIST-1&quot;&gt;TRAPPIST-1&lt;/a&gt;, especially since we've gotten a slew of questions about it in the last 24 hours. The point of all this is that it would be fantastic if members of the Astronomy Stack Exchange community could give us some ideas to work with. I've already read through the discovery paper, but obviously, plenty of folks here know more about TRAPPIST-1 and exoplanets in general than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, what would you like us to put in the post? Discussions of orbital stability? The formation of the planets outside the frost line? A brief overview of ultracool dwarfs? Liquid water? Something else entirely?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want to use this blog post to promote cross-site interactions, and also to give some publicity to Astronomy Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.meta.stackexchange.com/q/405/6&quot;&gt;Original post on Astronomy.SE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not have Space Exploration participate as well?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Worldbuilding's mandate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Worldbuilding Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for
  writers, artists and others using science, geography and culture to
  construct imaginary worlds and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I take it the matter here is what fascinating fictional worlds can be created based on the discoveries at TRAPPIST-1. That would seem to be a matter that could go all over the place. Where do exobiologists fall in the Stack Exchange ecosystem? Planetary science is shared by Astronomy and Space Exploration, I think there are lots of interesting things to ponder there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I wondered about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How space travel between those planets would work. What are the delta V budgets, how often are good trajectories available? They are all tidally locked, and being so much smaller than their star, their Lagrange points with the star would be fairly close to them - would space elevators on those planets work better or worse than they do for rotating planets? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kinds of temperature gradients are we talking about between the sun-ward and space-ward hemispheres of these planets? How much can an atmosphere or oceans moderate that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would communications between these planets be like? Is radio noise from the star a big deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would wind turbines and solar power work extremely well on these worlds, giving early industrial societies an interesting option we didn't have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I've listed them, it seems to me that most of those questions would be legitimate questions on SX. But, I don't really have time... If anyone thinks they are good questions for our site, please go ahead and ask. :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;A very good question was raised during the press release - somebody asked about if material could be transported between the planets because they are so close - kind of like how material ejected from Io can end up on Europa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mentioned in the press release (and I made a question about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/20160/are-the-trappist-1-planets-in-stable-orbits&quot;&gt;Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;) that the planets likely started further from the star and migrated closer to the star.  So what if a civilization started on the planet closer to the star, and as it moved closer to the star, they had to develop spaceflight.  Then they planet-hop and migrate their entire civilization and biosphere from planet to planet as the closer planets move out of the habitable zone and the further ones move in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They'd originally signed the post, but this was removed as part of normal SE housekeeping. There is no verifying information in the profile, where it should have appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this is not a good SE answer, because the supporting information is essentially of the form &quot;it's somewhere in this list that I also wrote.&quot; There are some active users here that over time have established identity and authority in certain areas, but this it the first post by this user id. (spot checks did not seem to suggest this list contains verification either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there's a good chance the post is by who it seems to be by, and the answer has accumulated a score of up votes, and up voting is supposed to be one indicator of an answer's quality and possibly correctness, and if the answer were glaringly wrong I have a hunch other readers would have caught the problem quickly and pointed it out. At least I assume some of the up voters checked... right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, do user ids that appear to be people with Wikipedia pages and asteroids get a pass on standard procedure, or should I hold out and not accept until the answer gets some independent verification/validation, or the user is somehow verified, or one of the many people who double-checked before reflexively up voting takes a moment to edit the question and help the busy poster out?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;You wanted a more specific answer than what Rory gave you, so here is my best shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we treat experience and prior history of good answers as a proxy for verification (like with Mark Adler, as you mentioned in the comments). This is not because these are good measures of verification in and of themselves, but because we recognize that there are things that users like Mark Adler can personally verify that would take an inordinate amount of resources to independently verify. We do this because Mark continues to be an active user in this community and there are other users who can challenge in cases where his information may be off. For all of these cases, we should always be cautious to validate what we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a new or unregistered user, even if you believe they might be a notable individual with relevant experience, I do not believe we should take their experience as a proxy. There is no guarantee of return on this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to identify, as Rory said, that the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; criteria for upvote and acceptance  of an answer is its truth and helpfulness, not any factor of the poster. Usually, we require citations to validate an answer, and a citation can also make an answer more helpful. &lt;strong&gt;If an answer has not helped you, don't upvote or accept it.&lt;/strong&gt; We have plenty of cases where other users &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; validate the answer and do upvote it to the top, despite the OP being unconvinced. The system still works to deliver good content to viewers. If people are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; upvoting for good reasons, we have comments, flags, and moderators to intervene to get these answers fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always have to accept, though, that we cannot guarantee the truth of any answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="975" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;The 2013 SXSE question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/249/12102&quot;&gt;Resources and references on the topic of space exploration&lt;/a&gt; was kindly migrated to meta, and recognizing the value of a central source, 5 answers were posted with a really nice cross-section of resources listed. This is one of those rare exceptions to &quot;list&quot; questions where the benefits to the whole community were recognized and an exception made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had I not caught the recent question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/22350/12102&quot;&gt;How would one go about learning rocket science? [on hold]&lt;/a&gt; with closing imminent (4 close votes after only 3 hours) it's possible the user would never have known about the helpful collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's several options, including moving to meta then marking as duplicate, but the problem is (probably) that the first four close-voters had never seen the question in meta and all of it's helpful goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure if one of them knew about it, something better and more helpful would have happened than a solitary &lt;em&gt;You did something wrong&lt;/em&gt; and a complementary down vote, without even a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/help&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/tour&quot;&gt;take the tour&lt;/a&gt;, much less a &quot;welcome to SE&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there some ways to raise awareness of helpful collections of resources? At least the one &quot;Resources and references...&quot; that I've linked to above? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(there's also &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/472/12102&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for example with 10 answers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, there are indeed plenty of well received questions here and in other SE sites that ask for resources. &lt;strong&gt;Of course SE can be and is used to ask for resources&lt;/strong&gt;. The issue is with the &lt;em&gt;breadth of the question and unlimited number of possible answers&lt;/em&gt; with the general wording. At the minimum, when leaving the &lt;em&gt;you've done something wrong&lt;/em&gt; and the complementary down vote, we should at least make an effort to explain correctly how to improve this or future questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moderators are human exception handlers, there to deal with those exceptional conditions that could otherwise disrupt the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our site has not altogether banned questions framed as skeptical of the moon landing, we have decided as a community to take a strong stance against users entrenched in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;denialism&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, determining when this is the case and how to take action is subjective, but that is the type of decision that moderators are there to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Musk was asked whether SpaceX can increase the Falcon Heavy’s performance over time, much like it has with the Falcon 9. That’s when the CEO suggested the possibility of a Falcon Super Heavy — a Falcon Heavy with extra boosters. “We could really dial it up to as much performance as anyone could ever want. If we wanted to we could actually add two more side boosters and make it Falcon Super Heavy,” Musk said. This five-rocket Falcon Super Heavy would have around 9 million pounds of thrust, Musk said, nearly doubling the rocket’s current capability, and putting it in line with the Saturn V as the most powerful rocket ever built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is a starry-eyed optimist and he talks a good game, but typically backs it up with actual development. But FSH is more along the lines of this concept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We strapped 2 rockets onto another one, why not 5?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's different about this, vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bfr&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;bfr&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;bfr&lt;/a&gt;, is that BFR has some actual development behind it (they've at least built a tank). Maybe FSH will become a thing, but there's only Musk's one quote about it and it's far from the only project being talked up without any actual development (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mars-one&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;mars-one&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;mars-one&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/12166/does-mars-one-actually-do-anything&quot;&gt;appears to be a Mars-mission PR firm&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much speculation do we tolerate in creating new tags?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have a problem that it's not clear where the line is. In this case, I would say it is rather clear that this has crossed the line. As you said, it is one question about something that Musk mentioned one time. That doesn't need a tag. Now, if we had a lot of questions about it, maybe we could justify needing a tag, even if it was just a concept. There's no need to preemptively create a tag for it though, especially since the name of this concept could change if Musk does pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Physics SE there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/714/83380&quot;&gt;How do I ask homework questions on Physics Stack Exchange?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/7407/83380&quot;&gt;Generalizing the homework policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for example, and a lot more, and in Astronomy SE there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.meta.stackexchange.com/q/87/7982&quot;&gt;Homework policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Does this site have anything like a homework policy, &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; or stated? Is there some generally accepted advice to give OPs who post what looks like a homework question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; There's just been another &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/26687/12102&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; suggested to be a homework question a comment suggesting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/334823/3904031&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow meta answer&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;our homework policy.&quot; That question was subsequently closed and possibly some close voters were swayed by the statement that that question in some way violated &quot;our policy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that the nature of Stack Overflow is somewhat different than this site, we may not be able to hold the truth as self-evident that our policy is identical to SO's. &lt;strong&gt;Why not propose one specifically for this site?&lt;/strong&gt; It could be based on SO's since that one seems well though out and measured. Alternatively one could propose to point directly to that as an answer here which could then be voted on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not asking &lt;em&gt;what you think it should be&lt;/em&gt;, although that might be an excellent follow-up question for someone else to ask. I'm just curious if there is some general practice or thought on this already, and an extension of that might be if one thinks there needs to be or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;All right, since no one's jumping in. I'm going to declare by mod fiat. &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, we do not have a homework policy. As usual, my mod fiat can be overruled by the community. If this post nets a negative score, then perhaps we do have one, though I would suggest we need a follow-up question to define clearly what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go ahead and repeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/982/does-this-site-have-anything-like-a-homework-policy#comment3855_982&quot;&gt;my comment&lt;/a&gt; here for further info:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I guess the answer is no? Really, my opinion is hold all answers to the same standard--if so-called homework problems are able to meet that standard, then so be it. The problem with the question you referenced above is that it didn't show any prior effort to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and since you mentioned another question, my opinion is that the problem with that question is that it is unclear what exactly the OP hopes to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already seen the new Stack Overflow blog post, please take the time to do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/?cb=1&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow Isn’t Very Welcoming. It’s Time for That to Change.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed this tidbit hidden in a footnote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This post focuses on Stack Overflow, but most of it applies to the broader Stack Exchange network as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say it absolutely applies here. Let's start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Space Exploration Stack Exchange] is intended to be an inclusive place where every[one with a space question] can participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s shift  from “don’t be an asshole” to “be welcoming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you respond to a post or a comment, try to maintain a positive attitude. I'm not pointing fingers. I think most of us have had a day where we hopped on SE without enough coffee, if you know what I mean. If you can't respond kindly, don't respond. If the other user is being rude and you can't respond kindly, flag their post. If the other user is violating the rules and you can't respond kindly, flag their post. There is no reason to stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice&quot;&gt;being nice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can keep a positive attitude, go a step further and make sure the user is &lt;em&gt;fully welcome&lt;/em&gt; in the community. Don't make assumptions based on reputation or level of participation in the site. Make sure the user knows that we're glad to have more contributions. Make sure the user knows what our standards are and why. Take a moment and explain briefly what they need to improve, what our rationale is, and point them to our Help Center for further instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s do something about comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more condescension or sarcasm. I will be deleting these on sight. If I've missed it, don't assume I condone it. Flag it and I'll take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s make it easier for new users to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SE plans on trying out a beginner page, but we can start doing this without the technical framework. If they are new to SE or to Space Exploration and it's not clear what their question is, gently explain to them that our site is meant for clear Q&amp;amp;A. Help guide them to include a clear question in their post. Even consider editing their post for them, as sometimes new users have trouble figuring out how the edit mechanic works. Do this before downvoting--they are new, and we can't expect perfection, especially when we have the tools to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they haven't demonstrated prior work, try to walk them through what they might have done and can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s stop judging users for not knowing things. (We’re a Q&amp;amp;A site!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't downvote duplicates. They are not an affront to the site. Make sure you explain to new or confused users why you see it as a duplicate. Often users don't see the answer to their question in the duplicate and need some help. Sometimes their answer &lt;em&gt;isn't actually in the other Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/em&gt;, and they need help to rewrite their post to clarify their actual question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't bully people answering duplicates. Now, if they vote to close and post an answer, you can gently provide them guidance on how to handle the issue, but let's not berate the answerer or the OP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect there are more ways in which we can be more welcoming. If you have an experience you want to share about way(s) that this community has been less than welcoming to you, feel free to email me at called2voyage@gmail.com. I will keep our communication private. Of course, you're also welcome to reach out to the SE team, especially if you don't feel comfortable sharing your issue with me. I just want to be proactive about making our community a more welcoming place. If you are comfortable with me sharing our communication with other Space Exploration mods and/or the SE team, please let me know in your email. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There was a discussion in the chat room of Blender.se today about the same thing. They are a graduated site, with enough traffic that weariness has set in for them when handling their high number of unclear, very confused, or unresearched questions, opinion questions, spam, jokes... They also suffer from the fact that it is actually rather hard to search there for previous answers to your question - the key words are too common, or there is too many ways of saying it, or you need the knowledge you are looking for in order to know how to search for it. It will be a while before we have that level of traffic, but it's worth noting, the grind gets worse as sites grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my own experience, I think some things help. If you aren't really in the mood but you see red dots in the review queue or something you could answer - let it go. To do this job well takes many hands. Stepping back actually helps more hands to appear and get accustomed to the work. I have had difficulty doing this sometimes. Especially when the work I'm actually supposed to be doing is more challenging than doing review, leaving comments, and whatnot. But when I do leave it, usually when I come back someone else has already done good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to take a post the wrong way, especially comments or chat posts. The format is very terse, and text isn't good at getting across mood at the best of times. If I'm not in a good mood, I sometimes default to imagining all posts spoken in the voice of someone who makes me comfortable. Like Conan O'Brien. Just works for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a high rep member for me sometimes feels a bit uncomfortable (and also a former mod). I get defensive more easily when caught in a mistake. I had trouble with that before, having people think I know more than I do because otherwise how did I get so many points just makes it worse. There I said it. That helps. Sometimes the opportunity to clear the air about feelings is there and will really help if you take it. Other times it really isn't. It's a limitation of the format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to assume everyone you deal with is short on time. It can take the edge off when someone doesn't follow up, or takes a long time to respond. And it is likely true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about asking people to be kinder, is you have to give them tools to be kinder. Because we also have to be firm, and be able to criticize without being harsh, which is very challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire endeavor has been built on volunteer work. Everything. We are a tiny enclave on Stack Exchange, there is no profit motive anywhere here whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's extraordinary. It makes me feel good about humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I can see that point, I can also see that this user isn't expecting a complete and rigorous answer. He just needs a starting point, which fits neatly in a 3-paragraph SE answer. It's also an answer that can't be easily arrived at by Googling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMO this is what the 'be welcoming' discussion is about: closing questions by new users instead of helping them on their way. Or am I reading this situation incorrectly? &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;It is always better to leave an answer, if you can provide enough information to make a good answer. Some sites will even delete any attempts to answer in the comments. Here we're a little looser with that rule. Space is hard, and often it takes a lot of little leaps to get to a final answer. As a community we have decided to allow comments that point toward a solution but aren't sufficient to make a good answer. That said, if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see a comment that would be a good answer in its own right, it is perfectly fine to suggest that the user turn it into an answer. If it gets turned into an answer or someone else incorporates the info into an answer, you can flag the comment for deletion. Also, if you see a pattern of a particular user trying to put actual answers (as opposed to guidance toward a solution) in the comments, you can flag their comments.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about Python. It is an extremely popular choice for this type of thing because it has a bunch of great libraries, so I'm not sure we can avoid questions involving Python. As much as possible these questions should be about the actual implementation of space operations in Python and not the usage of a particular library, or the regular usage of Python. If NASA has pages focused on Python (&lt;a href=&quot;https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto/596e684bcbdc835ca1df23c2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto/596e684bcbdc835ca1df23c2&lt;/a&gt;) I think it makes sense for us to have a tag, but we need to carefully monitor its use, and someone should probably take the initiative to write up some guidelines in the tag wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would leave this alone. It's part of the user's manner of speech, and it expresses that they are asking the question out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question was previously titled (and worded internally) as being about a &quot;space-based&quot; laser. The laser is not planned to be space-based (which would mean the laser is in space) and the article never claimed as much either. I suggest we keep the question referring to &quot;space laser&quot; as in the article and not &quot;space-based laser&quot;, because we do not need to suggest to viewers that anyone is planning to put a laser cannon in space when that is not being proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;Overall voting, on both our questions here in Meta on how to handle our steady trickle of questions regarding supposed evidence we never went to the Moon, seem to show that as a community we'd prefer to handle such questions by having one question and answer that properly addresses the whole thing, and then we could close all related questions as duplicates. Other opinions have been offered, but that seems to be the majority stance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those questions are the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1002/4660&quot;&gt;Does the community spend too much time on debunking conspiracy theories?&lt;/a&gt;, and the older &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/624/4660&quot;&gt;Do we want to touch the “moon hoax”?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, posting such a thing in a way that is acceptable to our community is a delicate business. Arguments that the matter is too broad for our format are legitimate. I come down on the side of the fence that the issue is important enough that it should stand as a question anyhow, for the sake of doing the best service possible both to our own community and the sadly large community of moon hoax believers, misguided though they may be. I guess that stance also covers all the other arguments about the unsavory nature of wading into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the controversial and delicate nature of this, I'm going to post an initial draft of such a question, and make it a community wiki so we can work on it until we are satisfied. Then we can post it on SX.SE. Called2voyage suggested that approach, and I agree. He suggests doing the same thing with the answer to the question, and then when we have both question and answer, they can be posted together quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because frankly, the reason why this hasn't happened already is because we all know that conspiracy theory questions get downvoted out of existence around here usually within minutes. Feelings about it run high. Posting such a question for the sake of trying to handle it properly will almost certainly attract downvotes as the wider community who don't usually come to Meta weigh in on the matter. The comment thread is going to get long, and so on and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly the only way to do this successfully is to make sure there is an answer to the question that will satisfy our members before they downvote it on general principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, here goes...&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Moving my comment to an answer: there is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. It's not just for web pages. They keep archives of documents, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for something specific to space exploration, I'm not sure if there is a site specifically designed for uploading documents, but there may be sites interested in hosting your material. You could try, for example, contacting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetary.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Planetary Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do opt to self-host, let the good folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq&quot;&gt;Charcoal&lt;/a&gt; know so they can whitelist you. (Thanks, @Machavity!)&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; What might be a good way to incentivize and/or promote the generation of definitions and wikis for undocumented or under-documented tags in this site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to think of perhaps some kind of campaign, or contest that would be both fun and helpful to the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no lack of users who are qualified, or of people who are naturally motivated to explain or define in helpful ways, but editing/improving tags hasn't been gamified (&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/27167/284619&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) the same way questions, answers, or even to some extent comments have been. There are badges, but not the near-instant gratification of the up-vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if some kind of community wiki for proposed definitions and wikis of say the top 20 or 50 popular yet undocumented tags might work, but that's just one idea, there may be better ways, perhaps a special tag-hat or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/932/12102&quot;&gt;hat size&lt;/a&gt; mod?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What got me started writing this is the use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/j-2&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;j-2&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;j-2&lt;/a&gt; tag on &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/30568/12102&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; about $J_2$. While I'm guessing the tag was originally created to refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_J-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rocketdyne J-2&lt;/a&gt; engine, the OP likely started typing J or J2 in the tag selection box and it appeared like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/4h1pL.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/4h1pL.png&quot; alt=&quot;the j-2 tag in Space Exploration SE&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and since there is no guidance either way is immediately provided, the tag was selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; The only tag currently on the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/30769/12102&quot;&gt;Could a gyrojet fire arm be used in space or has it?&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/space-gun&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;space-gun&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;space-gun&lt;/a&gt; and the problem here is that all the other questions are about a type of launch technology, not a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update:&lt;/strong&gt; I've added a definition for this tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of my earlier &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;mea culpa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; meta question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/881/12102&quot;&gt;Easiest way to get a list of tags for which I've bee the first user?

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;I asked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/30927/what-happens-to-rocket-stages-that-land-in-the-oceans-and-how-many-are-still-th&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about jettisoned rocket parts residing in the ocean, and tagged it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/waste&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;waste&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;waste&lt;/a&gt;, but this tag was removed in an edit, presumably because most other instances of this tag relate waste products from humans or spacecraft in space, so it wasn't considered a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking that perhaps a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pollution&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pollution&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; tag would be useful, and appropriate for my question. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;You know, this idea actually makes sense to me. Eight years ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/54300/228367&quot;&gt;Jeff Atwood&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is effectively completed, because&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bounty system is no longer tied to accepting an answer in any way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can issue multiple bounties on your question if necessary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's think about this. Stringing together a series of four +50 bounties gives you an effective bounty period of 28 days, so why not just allow for +200 bounties to go for 28 days? Some users may not want them to last that long, but like you say, you can just make the length customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows for risk aversion on large bounties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintains the impression of a lump sum to answerers, thus potentially motivating them more than multiple small bounties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development and maintenance cost for the adjustable length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds another piece to the already complex bounty system that must be explained to the user&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;@Conelisinspace let's be practical. Using your definition, we would
  have to tag every single question on the site that involves biology in
  space. That's impractical, and it renders the tag to mean just biology
  in space. What would be the most helpful way for the tag to be used,
  and how has it been used on this site until now? If people are
  following the tag, then suddenly using it in a new and clever way may
  upset the apple cart. – uhoh 31 mins ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the community's thoughts on the astro-biology tag, and the life tag?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/life&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;life&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; should be used to tag the experimentation with life, from earth, in space or the study of biological processes involving earth, while in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or visa-versa, they're both kind of synonymous and the descriptions for the tags are ambiguous and (honestly) not very good, I believe they should be updated, but to what I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Neither this month nor the past seven months have had an unusual number of questions closed. The last anomaly was in February when we had 41 questions closed. For reference, this month 19 questions have been closed. The February anomaly coincided with the Starman launch. We received a large number of questions during that time, many of which needed to be closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been different about this year from 2016 and 2017 is that we haven't had an idle period. In 2016 and 2017 there were months where the number of questions closed dipped down to 9 (or even zero in January). This was due to having a lower volume of questions in general. This year we have not experienced a reduction in questions asked to the degree that we have seen such a dip in questions closed, not even in January. This is probably largely the aftermath of the Starman launch. While not everyone who asked questions during that time stuck around, we did get a number of new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't explain January, but perhaps we saw a surge of questions (relative to previous Januarys) at that time in preparation for the Starman launch.&lt;/p&gt;

I believe the physics is wrong, since conservation of angular momentum prevents a satellite from raising its orbit around a spherically symmetric body by using only gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem in the answer is the conflation of center-of-mass and center-of-gravity, which are of course are usually not the same position in a gravity gradient, and certainly not blindly interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation and equations given there express the central body's contribution only through μ which is G time the mass of the Earth. Without torque, you can't use Earth's gravity to boost the orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this site generally regards physical principles like conservation of angular momentum in few-body mechanics problems as given, and within that context, the answer is therefore wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is stack exchange and wrong answers happen and get accepted, but this one is demonstrably wrong based on basic conservation of angular momentum arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've left several comments there within the long comment chain that exists there, though a key few relating specifically to torque are now missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options I can think of include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong vs. &quot;demonstrably wrong&quot; is not a distinction we make here.

Generally, we should be relying on the community to resolve these issues. Moderators will usually step in only if there is a flagrant disregard for justifying information.

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="1129" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;I feel like there is a handful of users who stop by the site thinking &quot;let's see, what can I close today?&quot; or &quot;Hmm... what looks particularly close-able?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that's not the case, or at least that it's not so black-and-white, but still, for many questions by new users, if it is worded in a slightly non-standard way, or could be adjusted slightly to be better, there seems to always be one, or two close votes within hours, and these almost always appear without any kind of a helpful comment or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the site less welcoming, and being welcoming is really important and part of our new SOP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this even more unwelcoming is that the silent close votes (those without any helpful comment) &lt;em&gt;are invisible&lt;/em&gt; to low-rep users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SO or a few of the very high question-rate sites, the old &quot;close early, close often&quot; thinking was a way to keep heads above water. Here with what varies between 5 and 10 questions a day (it's picked up over the last several years, but I think it's roughly 4,000 questions in the last 1,000 days) this kind of quick, silent close voting is just not warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or two users leave helpful comments, then we just let the question sit for a day to make sure the user has had a chance to see the comments and make a change to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or two users &lt;em&gt;make a helpful edit&lt;/em&gt; to the question along with a helpful comment explaining why, and then see how things go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing both of these for a while now and the results are quite good. Most of the time I get a &quot;thanks&quot; message, everything is fine, and the OP learned something through positive reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, closing the question makes a big mess, renders the question unavailable for answering, and requires more work to re-open it. To me that unpleasant experience seems punitive to new users, and profoundly &lt;em&gt;unwelcoming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can something be done to encourage the silent insta-close voters to consider just leaving the question alone for a while, especially in the situation where the OP doesn't have enough reputation to even know that close-voting is in progress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to search for many examples, the most recent is &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/32880/12102&quot;&gt;Mass manufacturing of satellites&lt;/a&gt; which can probably be improved without the close/open cycle, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/32776/12102&quot;&gt;Game for teaching basics of orbital mechanics&lt;/a&gt; which had at least two close votes when I left my comment, and has since collected &lt;em&gt;ten answers&lt;/em&gt; 41 up votes and 13 favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;As promised, here is the full answer. The best thing you can do in these cases is to comment on the questions to help the OP clarify things and to make a case for the question. Also, if necessary, you can take specific issues to meta to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, there is not really much that can be done. Close votes are discretionary by nature and are mostly anonymous until the question is closed. It is impossible to head off these actions by any other means than what I've already suggested above. You mentioned the possibility of calls to action--these have been done. In my experience, the majority of users who leave reactionary close votes do not care about the calls to action. They either will not read them or will not care about the points made if they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like, you could propose some changes to the question closing mechanism or to privileges in general to try to encourage certain behavior. You could do that in another question here, but it would probably get better attention on Meta Stack Exchange. If you want to toss around some ideas in chat, others might have some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Setting the name &quot;speculation&quot; aside (which I've expressed my opinion of in the comments of JCRM's answer), my main issue with this idea is that it is too broad. &quot;Could this work&quot; applies to too many questions to really be much of a useful category. In fact, it would likely end up being pretty opinion-based, which sounds like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some possible alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can still imagine a draw of problematic questions to these, but it at least doesn't seem to promote them in name. We could add some language to the tag wikis to specify the standards we require of such questions, and we could police these tags to close poor questions.&lt;/p&gt;

Elon Musk likes to shoot from the hip and the F means something else. Unsurprisingly, they didn't want to issue press releases with that word, so the project has now officially been given a name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not technically accurate (this isn't going to go to another star system) but that's its name.

&lt;p&gt;We have over 60 posts that contain &quot;ExoMars&quot;, and 14 questions explicitly tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exomars&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;exomars&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;exomars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK-assembled rover that will be sent to Mars in 2020 will bear the name of DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The honour follows a public call for suggestions that drew nearly 36,000 responses from right across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Astronaut Tim Peake unveiled the name at the Airbus factory in Stevenage where the robot is being put together.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;IMO - the &quot;questionable&quot; one is fine, but the other two should be untagged. I don't think a general &quot;identify-this&quot; tag is useful. That's kind of the point of most questions: to explain the phenomenon the person asked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stage-separation+separation&quot;&gt;both tags&lt;/a&gt;: no questions at the moment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of &lt;code&gt;stage-separation&lt;/code&gt; is probably straightforward, but what are all of the types of things for which &lt;code&gt;separation&lt;/code&gt; would apply? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine booster and fuel-tank separations would count, but what about &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capsule separation as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/18885/12102&quot;&gt;Why does Blue Origin land the crew capsule separate from the booster?&lt;/a&gt; (stage, or no-stage?) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of the &lt;code&gt;separation&lt;/code&gt; tag in the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/19383/12102&quot;&gt;What is the closest intentional separation achieved by two satellites?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a Wiki excerpt be added to make sure it is for non-stage-separation-based separations? What should it say exactly, and what to do about capsules?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that you pointed out that not all separations may be considered related to staging, there is another implicit difference I see between these two terms--may not always be there but is definitely sometimes implied. &quot;Stage separation&quot; describes a process, whereas &quot;separation&quot; is a single event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I'm not clear on how we should define usage of these tags, but we do need to establish their usage guidelines and probably retag some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;I just created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reduced-gravity-manufacturing&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reduced-gravity-manufacturing&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reduced-gravity-manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; tag to go along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reduced-gravity-sports&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reduced-gravity-sports&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reduced-gravity-sports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reduced-gravity-cooking&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reduced-gravity-cooking&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reduced-gravity-cooking&lt;/a&gt; tags and then enthusiastically added it to eight questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last one I finally noticed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manufacture&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;manufacture&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt; tag exists already, but currently both tags only exist on three questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Related to the fabrication of products in space, or the techniques and logistics of production of rockets in series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It mentions manufacturing in space, but it also talks about &quot;techniques and logistics of production of rockets&quot; without reference to doing it in space. So it seems like a dual-use tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most uses of &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manufacture&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;manufacture&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt; do seem to relate to conventional manufacturing on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I propose to resolve this is to move all questions about &lt;em&gt;manufacturing in space&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reduced-gravity-manufacturing&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reduced-gravity-manufacturing&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reduced-gravity-manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; and all questions about manufacturing &lt;em&gt;on Earth&lt;/em&gt; of rockets or spaceflight-related items to &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manufacture&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;manufacture&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'd like to get the opinions of members valued here on a specific topic and want to ask an opinionated question which cannot have a correct answer. This is usually not a good idea due to this site's format, there's a known issue with posts which are tauted as 'popularity-contests' where the most popular (not most correct) answer is voted to the top. The purpose of Space.SE is to ask various scientific questions about space exploration and get a well-qualified &lt;strong&gt;and correct&lt;/strong&gt; answer. In terms of things that are popularity contests, there are no correct answers, so usually the site will ban/close/avoid such questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I've seen some pretty interesting opinionated SE's as well, and think a tag of &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/opinionated&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;opinionated&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;opinionated&lt;/a&gt; or something could be implemented to allow users to ask such questions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what is the best reference materials for orbital mechanics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what was the most influential space mission and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, why did NASA respond to X with Y?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what could NASA have done to prevent X?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like these are still &lt;strong&gt;very relevant to space exploration&lt;/strong&gt; even though they are opinionated. Half the reason I love this SE is that it opens new topics to me in a rapid-fire manner and I can learn an insane amount just by reading one of @uhoh's posts and clicking through his 10+ links. I feel like the users here are mature enough to write long, thought out answers with justifications for opinionated questions which could ultimately be great reads on a variety of topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Should opinionated questions still be off-topic? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the tag a good idea-- I've seen it work well on a few SE's!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links rot in general, and NASA has at least in the past done major and minor revisions to it's websites and filing systems. I've experienced that myself, seeing swaths of links disappear or end in 404's, and over the last few years seen it referenced (lamented) more than once in other, more experienced users' comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without at least the minimal &lt;code&gt;NASA TM X-2525&lt;/code&gt; reference, if the link breaks all you have is the following cryptic dead url:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparison of orbital mechanics with real life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comparison of rocket parts with real life&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bug that must be reported to KSP's developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new features in the game (or other roadmap related issues)&lt;/li&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;No, it is fully on topic on both sites. Overlap doesn't matter on Stack Exchange. A question always stays where it is asked, if it is on topic there. It doesn't matter if it is on topic elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as where users choose to ask a question, that just depends on what community they want to answer it. If they feel that the space exploration community will provide the answers they seek, then they should ask here. If they feel the astronomy community would provide answers they seek, then there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;To hopefully alleviate concerns regarding the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/conduct&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, I want to explain how I intend to moderate regarding pronoun use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When speaking generically, posts should use gender neutral language (which per the Code of Conduct means, for example, &quot;they&quot; not &quot;he or she&quot;). If a post doesn't, I will not be removing it on sight. If flagged, I will comment asking the user to make an edit. If they refuse, I will point them to the Code of Conduct and inform them of behavior expected on this site. If they cannot agree to abide by the Code of Conduct, I will remove their post. If a user is not active, I may elect to edit the post for them while waiting for their reply. I will not be seeking out posts to see if they comply. As usual, I will rely on flagging or whatever I happen to come across in my normal perusal of the site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number 1 does not apply to quotes. I will not require anyone to make editorial mark-ups of quotes to ensure they comply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When referring to other users on the site, posts should use gender neutral language until asked otherwise. If you want to check someone's bio to see if they've specified, you're welcome to, but I won't expect you to. Once asked to use a certain set of pronouns, per the Code of Conduct, you should use that set. If you don't and the post is flagged, I will edit the post or remove the comment and leave a comment explaining why. I am letting you know this now so that if you are not comfortable with me putting words in your mouth you will be aware. The reason I will be doing this instead of waiting for users to edit on their own is that leaving unaffirming pronouns around while waiting for edits would make the site unfriendly, per the Code of Conduct. If there is push back or an edit war, I will then handle according to how I would normally handle someone who refuses to follow the rules. I don't really see this coming up, but if a quote of some external source happens to refer to a known user of this site and uses the wrong pronouns, then you should use appropriate editorial conventions (brackets to replace incorrect words and a footnote to explain the edit) to rectify the problem. If you slip up and accidentally use the wrong pronouns, it's fine, we'll edit it and move on. There's no reason for moderator action over a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When referring to specific people not on this site, posts should use whatever pronouns Wikipedia does. You don't have to check in advance if you think you know their pronouns, but if someone edits in or requests a correction and points to the Wikipedia article, you should comply. If there is reason to believe the Wikipedia article is wrong, please leave a comment pointing to the source for the person's pronouns. When a person doesn't have a Wikipedia page, use whatever information you have (e.g. if a news article uses a pronoun, use that). Again, if you think you know their pronouns, you don't have to check in advance, but if someone requests a correction and points to a source (or if by chance the actual person joins the site and requests a correction) then you should oblige.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, I will use moderator discretion when handling these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/q/658/58&quot;&gt;this meta discussion&lt;/a&gt; we had previously, please do not go around editing other people's posts &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to update their language. If you feel it needs to be updated, comment and/or flag. However, if you are editing for another reason and you also see an opportunity to make something gender neutral that should be, you may edit it, but please leave a comment explaining why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a lot to process, but really I don't see this coming up very often. As described above, I don't see this really changing the way most of you write 90% of the time. It's not like there's a lot of astronauts with publicly requested pronouns! If something I said is unclear or if you have further questions, let me know. If you disagree with the new Code of Conduct, please take that commentary to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/334900/228367&quot;&gt;official Meta post&lt;/a&gt;. For this discussion, assume we are following the Code of Conduct as directed.&lt;/p&gt;

However, at some point during some interaction between the question asker and the author of one of the answer, the question asker realised that they actually wanted to know something else (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;XY problem?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggested to edit the question to better reflect the true question, since there were now two answers that answer the actual question better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@Arjang To be honest, the current accepted answer does not answer the question &quot;Samples of old guidance software&quot;. I suggest that you either edit the question so it better reflects what you really wanted to know (how spacecraft guidance computers work, given small computational resources) or ask that in a another question and edit this question to limit answers to examples of old guidance software source code. In this way future visitors will find what they expect from the question title. – Ludo 2 days ago &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OP did so and asked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/39378/samples-of-old-guidance-software-using-computational-resources-on-earth-implemen&quot;&gt;second question&lt;/a&gt;, which is actually their original question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, question 1 has two relevant answer and one irrelevant answer (mine), which has actually quite some votes. Question 2 has zero answers at this moment, but my answer should be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicate my answer in the second question and leave it in the original one; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicate my answer in the second question and delete my answer in the original one; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move my answer from the first question to the second question (if this is possible); or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget about it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was there a better way to handle this from my side instead of commenting to the first question (i.e. the above quoted comment).&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;We get those because Stack Overflow Blog is one of our feeds. Since that is the official Stack Exchange blog, we have it as a feed so that we can quickly see any SE updates. The blog also happens to have a lot of material geared toward Stack Overflow specifically, but we can't tailor which posts we get from the feed except by deleting them from the chat room after they post. We could remove the Stack Overflow Blog feed if there was sufficient interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="1410" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;In some other StackExchange networks, I am currently in, for example in Mathematics and Chemistry, I am able to post questions successively only after a delay of 40 minutes. But here on Space Exploration, I am able to post within 10 minutes, and this is really helpful as I don't need to wait till I post the next question. What is the reason for this? Or equivalently, why is this present on other sites of this network?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;On sites with a larger volume of users, spamming is a bigger issue, so rate limiting is a helpful tool to ease the load of community moderation. We don't have a problem with the moderation load here.&lt;/p&gt;

Isn't the question about planetary science and as such &lt;strong&gt;on-topic&lt;/strong&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I agree, it is not off-topic. It is firmly within the scope of planetary science which we allow here. We get a lot of questions mistakenly asked here that belong at Astronomy, and this one happens to also be on topic there, so users sometimes err on the side of marking off topic too quickly. That said, there were some other points raised in the comments to be addressed with the question, so rather than reopen I changed the close reason to &quot;too broad&quot;, which is what I believe uhoh voted for.&lt;/p&gt;
