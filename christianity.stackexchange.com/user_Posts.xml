  <row AnswerCount="7" Body="&lt;p&gt;Some disagree on whether a Christian in this life may fall utterly and lose or forfeit eternal life.  However, most Christians do agree that after death, the Christian is eternally secure in heaven (or the new earth).  And this seems to be well supported in Scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+10%3A28&amp;amp;version=ESV&quot;&gt;John 10:28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (ESV)&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;sup&gt;28&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;  I give them eternal life, and  they will never perish, and  no one will snatch them out of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+21%3A4&amp;amp;version=ESV&quot;&gt;Revelation 21:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (ESV)&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;sup&gt;4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;  He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and  death shall be no more,  neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems clear that Christians could not be susceptible to another &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man&quot;&gt;Fall&lt;/a&gt;.  My question is, Why?  What is the fundamental reason why Christians would not be susceptible to another Fall or rebellion against God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please answer from a Protestant, non-Calvinist perspective.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Possible responses I have considered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There will be no law, and thus no concept of sin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wouldn't rebellion against God would be considered sin, even apart from a &quot;law&quot;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After death we no longer have a sin nature, and are thus incapable of sin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But weren't Adam and Eve created without a sin nature, and yet sinned?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satan will be vanquished, unable to tempt us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But didn't Lucifer rebel without being externally tempted? If we are unable to rebel without a tempter, that implies that we will have less free will than Lucifer and the angels had.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will be unable to sin, either through lack of free will, or prevention by God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The argument that I usually use and hear for the existence of free will is that God would rather have willful obedience than robotic obedience.  Is God then hedging on this preference for the sake of our eternal souls?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have already been atoned for by Christ, so if we were to sin, it could not be counted against us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This allows for sin in heaven, which I can't buy.  It contradicts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2021:4&amp;amp;version=ESV&quot;&gt;Revelation 21:4&lt;/a&gt; for one thing, and makes heaven imperfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;When I was a Protestant, the most frequent answer that I received from authorities, and one I often used myself, was that the entire purpose of the church (the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth) was to prepare ourselves for our future glory. We, as the bride prior to the wedding, must make ourselves ready for the wedding day. In other words, we are constantly being perfected (shaped and trained to know, understand, and live what is good), so that when this age ends and the age to come is fulfilled we will be perfect at being good--no fall will occur because we will not desire to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is different than being created merely without a sin nature, as Adam and Eve were. It is being shaped into a heavenly nature. It is the free will alternative to forcing the &quot;robotic&quot; creation of a heavenly nature in the first place. A being merely without a sin nature does not desire sin because it is not aware of it, but upon being made aware of it can fall (taking on a sin nature). A being with a heavenly nature is aware of both good and evil, but desires only good.&lt;/p&gt;
