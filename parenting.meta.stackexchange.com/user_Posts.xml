We &lt;a href=&quot;https://parenting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/490/644&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; this previously somewhat, but now that the launch is imminent, I thought it would be a good time to clarify how we should handle overlapping questions:  those relationship problems that are also about parents.  Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;As the moderator of two sites with a pretty large overlap (Space Exploration and Astronomy), I thought I'd leave you some advice that was given to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beofett has already touched on this, but I figure any extra advice is welcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ok if some posts that come on Parenting would also be on topic on Relationships &amp;amp; Dating and vice versa. What matters is whether or not it is on topic &lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally, if it is on topic here, &lt;strong&gt;don't migrate&lt;/strong&gt;. If the question asked about the relationship between two adults happens to be very pertinent to parenting, then it should stay here.&lt;/p&gt;
