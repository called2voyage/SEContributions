  <row AcceptedAnswerId="3079" AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;Today I created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/accessibility&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;accessibility&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;accessibility&lt;/a&gt; tag for our now-growing category of posts dealing with issues such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/6532/gming-for-disabled-players-specifically-blind-players&quot;&gt;blind players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/27688/looking-for-a-game-that-does-not-need-anything-but-character-sheets&quot;&gt;prone players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/27710/how-can-i-make-things-easier-on-my-dyslexic-and-high-functioning-autistic-player&quot;&gt;dyslexic players, autistic players&lt;/a&gt;, etc. I also tagged one post (&lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/15148/how-can-i-help-my-pcs-remember-clues-that-they-found&quot;&gt;How can I help my PCs remember clues that they found?&lt;/a&gt;) as accessibility as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I am asking this question. The latter post that I mentioned does not on the face of it seem to have to do with accommodating disabilities or special needs, and (presumably) for this reason @SevenSidedDie untagged it from accessibility. I would argue that this post &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an accessiblity issue, however. First of all, Wikipedia defines accessibility as accommodating &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; people, especially those with disabilities or special needs. I paraphrased this in the tag excerpt for accessibility. Secondly, the post in question has one answer where the answerer states specifically that they have had these issues in cases with players who had learning disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously not all questions that have to do with making the game the best experience for players should fall in the accessibility category, but I think that this question should because it deals with a specific problem, that is very much like an issue that one with disabilities might face, that gets in the way of having a good gaming experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should we treat posts like this? Should we tag them with &quot;accessibility&quot; as I did (resulting in reverting SevenSidedDie's edit), or should we refrain from tagging them as such for the sake of clarity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that we could benefit from having posts like this together in the accessibility category, as it will help people who are having issues like this to find the information that is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;We use tags to categorise the content of a question. They may be useful to other people for other reasons than the original asker's reasons, but we don't tag for every hypothetical and real external motive for reading the question. (The five-tag limit is a feature to help encourage the specificity of tags.) In particular, we don't tag questions after the fact based on answers people give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that it's a very useful question for accessibility concerns, but it's not &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; accessibility. It could equally be extra-useful for GMs running a sandbox campaign, but the question isn't &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; running a sandbox campaign so we don't apply the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sandbox&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;sandbox&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;sandbox&lt;/a&gt; tag either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about tags is that they're hyper-focused labels on a question so that they can be grouped by question topic. They're an excellent supplement to our search feature, but they're not a replacement for searching the site. A GM needing help with players' memories, regardless of the reason, will find that question via search because they are looking specifically for questions about players' memory. If we start tagging with non-content tags, each question could potentially have many, many new tags that would suit, but that would make the tag system unmanageably and degrade its utility to the point where no-one would use it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I believe that SSD was correct in removing the accessibility tag from the question. I have a strong background in working with accessibility in an educational context, and can understand why you felt that the question should be tagged in that way, but ultimately I don't think it should as I think it would widen the scope of the tag so much as to make it far too broad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I see is that if we tag any question which is in any way linked to accommodating a certain group of people, then it will become extremely difficult to know where to draw the line. For example, there are questions on here that relate to 'categories' of players and how best to ensure GMs design their sessions in order to cater to them. You could argue then that it is about accessibility, as it is talking about accommodating a particular group of players in the same way as the question you have raised as an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about questions to do with improving the legibility of hand drawn maps, or using index cards as a GM to help remember NPC stats, or ways of organising notes so that they are easy to locate and remember that touch on the use of mind maps, colours and images?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;We need to more carefully define &quot;accessibility.&quot; I do not think the tag is &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; too broad, but I think it could be better defined so as to avoid that path. Here is my proposed definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is only for questions whose contexts require that the normal routes to play and/or solutions to the issue are not possible, and which require changes to the gameplay or mechanics to accommodate. In other words, accessibility is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; about making games easier or getting people to work together. Accessibility &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about situations in which normal methods for gameplay do not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the question &quot;How do I get my players to better remember the rules?&quot; has nothing to do with accessibility, because no unusual means are required for gameplay; this is something most people have to deal with at some point. However, the question: &quot;How do I get my &lt;em&gt;memory-impaired&lt;/em&gt; players to better remember the rules?&quot; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; accessibility, because the normal methods for teaching and learning rules may not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the tag is very specific, and is useful in searches. Its purpose would be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Here's my attempt at defining the scope for this new tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The tag should be used when a question's core focus is a physical or mental disability not found in most participants, preventing an optimal session. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The tag covers temporary and long-term disabilities as such issues and their solutions generally don't change just because the disability lasts a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the source of a problem is not explicitly such a disability and may be explained by other reasons, then the tag does not apply. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If an issue initially deemed to only apply to disabled participants were to objectively match a more common issue applicable to most gamers, the tag would not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(definition edited based on comments)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would include all the OP's questions under the tag except for the one about remembering quests specifically for the reason that the question does not explicitely state that the memory issue stems from mental difficulties. One may assume it comes from a willful lack of attention for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="11" Body="&lt;p&gt;It's the time of the year again, namely it is December 2013, and so we shall now refresh our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;useful resources for both the GM and the player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;utilities for running meets online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cool roleplaying events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]
   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be &lt;strong&gt;220 x 250 pixels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/3222&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
