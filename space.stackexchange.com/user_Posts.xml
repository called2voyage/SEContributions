  <row AcceptedAnswerId="714" AnswerCount="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;Obviously asteroids are abundant in many of the raw materials we use today, but considering the (presumably) large expense involved in mining from asteroids it may not be worthwhile to mine some materials since it is more cost-effective to get them on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are mainly three issues here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the approximate cost to develop an asteroid mining enterprise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would the approximate on-going cost of operations be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What resources are available on asteroids that would be more cost-effective to mine that way (considering the above expenses) than to obtain using conventional methods?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if any of these issues have been addressed in a technical paper or discussion to this level of detail, but I would appreciate as much detail as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Another matter of consideration is &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; we start developing the asteroid enterprise and &lt;strong&gt;how long&lt;/strong&gt; it would take to develop, because these things affect both the cost and benefit. Please take these into account in your answer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit for clarification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking primarily for asteroid mining of resources &lt;strong&gt;for use on Earth&lt;/strong&gt;, though an answer addressing asteroid mining of resources for use in space would also be interesting. Obviously the answer to the latter would be very different since it is probably &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; worthwhile to mine resources in space for use in space.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat a matter of opinion, but I believe the answer to your title question is &quot;NONE&quot;. That's why there aren't any major mining companies that are even remotely close to doing this. If there were resources on asteroids that merited the costs of mining them, then such companies would probably start to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two questions you raise (the ones labeled #1 and #2) are not really answerable in a general sense. There are so many parameters affecting the costs (either development or operating) that any &quot;general&quot; answer would be pretty much meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, there may be a time in the future when mining asteroids becomes economically reasonable. And despite the current economics, there have been plenty of serious attempts to start asteroid mining companies. The most notable presently is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetaryresources.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Planetary Resources, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the all-star line-up, however, none of the people involved have any mining experience (as far as I'm aware). They are mostly space enthusiasts who believe strongly in the long-term potential of exploiting space commercially. I would argue that they are motivated largely by their ideals, rather than by economics (which isn't a bad thing, and I wish them success!).&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The answer will depend on how we deplete our Earth resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fairly sure uranium would be extremely welcome since I've seen estimates that we have maybe 100 years worth of its supply, although it's yet to be found in bulk in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While iron is abundant on Earth, smelting its ores is costly both environmentally and financially, so a &quot;space forge&quot; using meteoritic iron ores and processing them into ready products (and delivering ready forms directly to the customer through aerial drop) would be viable. In this case lack of gravity and air could reduce the costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunar He&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is targetted as a potential energy source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still more in realm of sci-fi than actual science, but Jupiter's vast hydrogen supply could provide energy both for long-distance space travel and for power for Earth (although projects of &quot;beaming power&quot; (powerful masers) are more viable than just hauling hydrogen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more distant future, when sources of hydrocarbons on Earth are depleted, methane sources like Titan may become economically viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, though, robguinness' answer &quot;None&quot; is correct. We're still quite a bit away from the break-even point of costs vs profits. I'm sure once &quot;cheap&quot; sources of energy (both oil and uranium) get depleted, that will begin changing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;NASA has actually published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/news/asteroidmining.html#.Ue_RNaxnBW0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; on this. This study was the primary motivator for Planetary Resources to start its work on mining an asteroid. And there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mining.com/nasa-takes-asteroid-mining-serious-funds-viability-study-45382/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;more work&lt;/a&gt; being done by NASA to learn more as well. And there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/24/us-space-asteroid-mining-idUSBRE83N06U20120424&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the approach&lt;/a&gt; that Planetary Resources has set in place, which seems to be the best overall &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmag.com/planetary-resources-asteroid-mining/22298/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that should be noted is that Asteroids have large amounts of precious metals. Estimates show that even a small asteroid could have a fortune in Platinum, at least at today's prices. Work would need to be done to ensure that the value didn't plummet the economy. But, there are other options as well out there as to how an asteroid could be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 primary types of asteroids. C-type, S-type, and M-type. The latter two contain significant amounts of iron, and the C type carbon. Now, metal on the ground is quite cheap. The cost of Iron Ore is about \$115 per ton. It would therefor be difficult to make money on Earth using Iron Ore. However, there is an alternative way to make money. The Falcon 9 has a cost per pound of \$1800+ if loaded to it's maximum capacity. Thus, if you can make something useful in space of your asteroid, it's value has suddenly increased dramatically. The key for the short term profitability in space is the ability to manufacture and otherwise assist satellites. The amount of money that can be made increases dramatically if you can pull it off. Rocket Fuel, which could easily be made from an asteroid, has the same cost of \$1800/pound, if you can get it to the source. It might even be worth more, as fuel would extend the lifetime of the satellites, which are significant investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does it take to make a space mining operation profitable? Manufacturing. If you can develop an autonomous set of manufacturing robots, then you might be able to make something work. There is a number &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.space.com/15405-asteroid-mining-feasibility-study.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;often quoted&lt;/a&gt; of \$2.6 billion to break even, but that depends on making these advanced robotics work. It could work, but I think only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a whole world of microgravity manufacturing possibilities which has barely been touched. It's far easier to make some things in microgravity, but we haven't really explored that space very much yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest we've done to real space mining is the Apollo program. In total, it brought 382 kg of rocks, for a cost of around \$125 billion in today's dollars. Asteroids would be cheaper to go to than the Moon, and using unmanned spacecraft should make it cheaper, but the proven numbers we have gives a cost of about \$9200/ounce (\$325/g). If that cost can be reduced, which should happen by making it unmanned and the primary mission, then gold could be profitable fairly soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, it's a long time before the Earth mining industry will be affected by Space Mining, but it would likely significantly affect the aerospace industry, moving operations to on orbit. And some day, some of those materials will return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

In his question he mentions recycling solids in a farm, and during my research to answer his question I discovered that one paper discussed the possible use of dried human waste as a radiation shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really concerned with what is done with waste presently, but if there are any current recycling methods for human waste (excluding urine) they may certainly be addressed. Here's what I'm wondering: what is the most optimal method of recycling human solid wastes for sustainibility on a manned space vessel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll set the maximum limit on future development to be the rearrangement of molecules. Once we have technology on that scale, the reuse question is not as big of a concern (given that the energy requirements are low enough). Any future technology short of that, however, can be considered in the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Assuming we as race we colonize beyond our planet, with sustainable methods in our biological needs. Large quantities of organic material will be required, regardless if you are farming &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hydroponically&lt;/a&gt; or in soil, organic components are required to grow plants. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Soil&lt;/a&gt; is a combination of sand (&lt;em&gt;minerals&lt;/em&gt;) and organics. The only known source of organics in the universe are byproducts of earth life. As there is a significant cost in raising these organics to orbit, it makes financial sense to husband those organics we do get to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Composting&lt;/a&gt; is a time honored, simple, first step in the recycling of organic products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Night soils&lt;/a&gt;.  It does not require significant investments in technology, infrastructure or human resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current space habits are uniquely suited to support composting of night soils, as separation of solids and liquids is mutually desired.  There many articles available on the subject, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/composting-human-waste-zmaz73sozraw.aspx#axzz2aZ3g2FOz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; points out, layering the dry night soils with materials that are high in cellulose or carbon is good first step.  Generally composting principals of turning the compost (&lt;em&gt;speeds breakdown&lt;/em&gt;), and encouraging a warm moderately dry (&lt;em&gt;but moist&lt;/em&gt;) environment are all that is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composted organic materials are then mixed with water (Hydroponics) or sand (soil), and used to grow plants. As with any farming operation, plants that are grown and eaten raw should be properly washed before consumption. Processing methods appropriate for destroys pathogens are used in other applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be expected that early space farm produce would be fresh vegetables for human/animal consumption and fiber rich plants that can be made into paper (toilet paper!), cloth, and for feeding &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ruminants&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course everything goes back into the composting cycle.  Note that while composting animal protein (meat) is possible it requires a level of skill beyond this simple method. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;While answering according to &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; optimal sustainability may not be strictly possible at the present, there is a method being currently researched by NASA that may provide one of the best solutions to managing human waste on a manned space vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As of 2004) Dr. Bruce E. Rittman of Northwestern University lead the NASA-funded team to experiment with the use of human waste as fuel for electricity in a process involving the use of &lt;em&gt;Geobacter&lt;/em&gt; microbes for the generation of the electric energy. According to the NASA article, the best solution may be a combination of recycling the water from the waste, using it as fertilizer, and using it for electricity using this method that is currently being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA has not released any updates on the progress of this research since 2007, though it has been alluded to in Earth-oriented work on microbial fuel cells as recent as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468616301141&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm interested in is the influence the primary payload on the launch has on the standards to which hitchhikers are held. For instance, can a very risk-averse primary disallow CubeSats with propulsion? Does a CubeSat operator need permission from the primary operator to, say, turn on its radios? Do some requirements get relaxed somewhat if the CubeSat is housed in a container, like the P-POD? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or&lt;/strong&gt;, does the primary have no influence at all, in which case the CubeSats need only meet the requirements set by the launch vehicle provider?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="1655" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Recently, Air Force Space Command indicated that the space fence will be discontinued on October 1.[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/466832/air-force-space-command-to-discontinue-space-surveillance-system.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Due to resource constraints caused by sequestration, Air Force Space Command officials have directed the 21st Space Wing to prepare to discontinue operations at the Air Force Space Surveillance System by Oct. 1. Final decisions on all fiscal 2014 budget issues will be made over the next few weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will this decision affect contractors who are involved in the development and maintenance of the space fence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read a lot of public information about contracts possibly getting canceled, but also about new systems possibly replacing the old ones. Has the Air Force released any plans for what new systems might be and how they will be divided between contractors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More info on the space fence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The AFSSS, which has been operational since 1961, is just one part of AFSPC’s global Space Surveillance Network. The system is designed to transmit a “fence” of radar energy vertically into space to detect all objects intersecting that fence. The operational advantage of the AFSSS is its ability to detect objects in an un-cued fashion, rather than tracking objects based on previous information.  The disadvantage is the inherent inaccuracy of the data, based on its dated design. The new operating modes at Cavalier AFS and Eglin AFB will provide more accuracy than the AFSSS and still collect un-cued observations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The effect – caused by the rocket’s exhaust igniting hydrogen vented near the rocket – has scorched or even set fire to the first stage insulation on previous flights.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;As your source states, the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS, or &quot;the Fence&quot;, formerly NAVSPASUR) will be shut down come October 1 (really September). This means that the Air Force will not renew the contract for operating the AFSSS, which belongs to Five Rivers Services. So, obviously, those employees will be adversely affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the planned follow on (confusingly called Space Fence) is an entirely new and separate system. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have been competing for this new contract, but recently the Air Force &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/36919with-current-system-slated-for-closure-air-force-defers-next-gen-space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;deferred this decision&lt;/a&gt; following a Pentagon review of all major acquisitions, instead saying they plan to issue a new request for proposals. This would delay initial operating capability of the new system to at least 2018, which is one reason the (old) fence shutdown is worrying a lot of people in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the AFSSS shutdown is ostensibly due to Sequestration (budget problems), it is widely believed that it's actually to provide leverage when it comes to getting the new Space Fence funded (a belief that is only made stronger by the fact that Gen. Shelton, commander of Air Force Space Command, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/36974sn-blog-gen-shelton-on-space-fence-closure-and-the-road-ahead&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;can't string two sentences together about the shutdown without mentioning the Space Fence&lt;/a&gt;). In this sense, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are in an arguably better position, since this gaping hole in space surveillance capability highlights the need for the new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous analysis (see edit history), I erroneously included an MDM replacement on a Space Shuttle in 2008 as part of the ISS MDM replacements. I also skimmed over the 2007 replacement and did not realize that it involved replacing not one but &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; MDMs. The MDMs (best described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/MDMs.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this infosheet&lt;/a&gt; from Honeywell) are divided into three tiers. There are three Tier 1 MDMs responsible for Command and Control. One is primary, and the other two are backups. There are six categories of Tier 2 MDMs which relay commands to various systems. Two MDMs exist for each category--one primary, one backup. Finally, there are three categories of Tier 3 MDMs which execute commands from the Tier 2 MDMs. In the Internal Systems category are 11. Twelve are Power Systems MDMs, and 8 are External Systems MDMs. In all, that's 46 MDMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is notable that in the first decade of the life of the ISS three backup Tier 1 MDMs have had to be replaced, and one primary Tier 1 MDM had to be replaced at the same time as the backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we confidently say that the reliability of MDMs is increasing, that is, can we disentangle the effects of solar cycles from changes in manufacturing quality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5wZt.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sunspot Number Progression&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we only have three data points, there is a high margin of error for extrapolating from them. We can see that the first replacement coincided with a crest in solar activity, and the next three coincided with a trough, though there were momentary spikes in magnetic activity that may have coincided with the MDM failure. The most recent MDM failure &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; coincide with a crest in activity, but unlike the previous failures this was an external MDM and not one of the Tier 1 MDMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this it is difficult to derive a correlation between the solar cycle and the need to replace MDMs. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, it is notable that both solar activity crests in the lifetime of the ISS coincided with MDM failures! We cannot say with any confidence that the reliability of MDMs is increasing. It seems that a few MDMs need to be replaced every 6 years or so. The Command and Control MDMs seem especially vulnerable, which is a serious issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the lessons from the ISS avionics experience for our future missions beyond LEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only five of the 46 MDMs have had to be replaced during the life of the ISS. A few do seem to need to be replaced every six years or so, so it may be necessary to take this into account for future missions beyond LEO. However, since we have little data on the effect of the solar cycle on MDMs, it is difficult to tell what effect increased radiation beyond LEO will have on MDMs. It may be that increased radiation results in a greater frequency of computer failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of the Tier 1 MDMs is particularly troublesome if solar activity is connected to the failure, because the more extreme environment beyond LEO may make this untenable with the current technology. On the other hand, there hasn't been another Tier 1 failure since 2007, so perhaps the issue has already been handled.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Because of the slightly fuzzy understanding of planes demonstrated in this question and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/834/49&quot;&gt;HyperAnthony's similar question&lt;/a&gt;, I want to clear up the matter of planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, keep in mind that planes are two-dimensional. They have zero thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invariable (or invariant) plane is the plane that passes through the center of mass of the solar system perpendicular to the solar system's angular momentum vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ecliptic plane is the plane on which the Earth's orbit is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, most objects are going to be inclined (at an angle away from) these planes. In the case of planets, it is significantly so. Here is a handy chart from Wikipedia that shows the inclinations of each of the planets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/dj0lq.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inclination Chart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all of our destinations in the solar system (and even in the galaxy) are inclined from the ecliptic plane, travel to those destinations involves plane transfer (changing the inclination of the space craft relative to the ecliptic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater the change in inclination, the greater delta v required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change inclination to perpendicular to the invariable plane would require &quot;an enormous delta v&quot;, as PearsonArtPhoto said in his answer. Just how much would this be? Well, for a simple plane change (where the orbit size stays the same), $\Delta V = 2V_i * sin (\theta / 2)$. $V_i$ is the initial velocity, and $\theta$ is the angle change. That's nearly 1.4 times the initial velocity &lt;strong&gt;increase in velocity&lt;/strong&gt; to transfer from the ecliptic plane to a plane perpendicular to the invariable plane. And that's assuming you don't have to change the size of your orbit (which you will).&lt;/p&gt;

Some of these claims are dubious, whereas others seem to have some substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five types of purported encounters:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Capcom: Roger. What direction is it from you?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Borman: It's about 2:00 o'clock position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Capcom: Does that mean it's ahead of you?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Borman: It's - ahead of us at 2:00 o'clock and it's slowly tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Capcom: Roger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon Cooper&lt;/strong&gt; - a NASA astronaut and one of the original seven astronauts on Project Mercury&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Encounter - UFO sighting in the early 1950s, before his days as an astronaut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100327122001/http:/www.space.com/sciencefiction/phenomena/cooper.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Space.com article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On one occasion, I saw some strange vehicles that we assumed were UFOs,&quot; he told Bell. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the encounter, which took place over Germany in the early 1950s, Cooper saw &quot;flights of fighters flying by in the same sort of formation we flew, moving east to west.&quot; The U.S. Air Force base scrambled its own pilots, including Cooper, who remembers the objects as looking &quot;just like saucers -- they were metallic looking, but we couldn't really get close enough to see more than that. You couldn't see any wings on them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second Encounter - UFO sighting in 1957, also before his days as an astronaut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the same Space.com article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He also stood by his belief that he saw a UFO land at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 1957. Although Cooper had been filming the base with a camera crew at the time, the film, which he handed over to a high-ranking officer from Washington, has never emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pavel Popovich&lt;/strong&gt; - a Soviet cosmonaut, commander of Vostok 4 and Soyuz 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sole Encounter - UFO sighting at an unspecified time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popovich was a UFO researcher for the Soviet government, and it is likely this account occurred during or after his work as a UFO researcher. The primary source for the account is the UFO documentary &lt;em&gt;Out of the Blue&lt;/em&gt;, and it is possible that his account may be misconstrued due to bias. However, without any record of Popovich contesting the presentation of his account in this documentary, this answer will tentatively assume it was accurately reported. Here are the English subtitles of his account in &lt;em&gt;Out of the Blue&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For some reason, I was compelled to look out the plane's window. I looked and my eyes grew real big. I saw next to us, about one and a half kilometers away, and about 1,000 meters higher, there is a flying object. Its shape is a perfect right triangle. It was white, white, a very bright white. I'm a pilot, a fighter pilot, and I know many different types of flying crafts. It was like nothing I've ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Out of the Blue&lt;/em&gt; narrator explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[He was] flying home from Washington, D.C. with a delegation of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pilots contacted ground control. Ground control did not detect anything on radar, even though the object could be seen by all occupants of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popovich continues (English subtitles):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It travelled a parallel course. And its speed -- if we were travelling approximately 950 to 1,000 kph, it was travelling at about 1,500 kph, because it passed us rather quickly. In about 30 or 40 seconds it passed by, and overtook us. And that's all. And no academic, or anybody, could say what that object was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sole Encounter - UFO sighting in 1951, before his days as an astronaut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to his autobiography &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=z_xE22Pp2P0C&amp;amp;pg=PA50&amp;amp;lpg=PA50&amp;amp;dq=%22Hynek%20contacted%20me%20once%20about%20my%20story%22%20Deke&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=FvJaAAel8N&amp;amp;sig=WqIQj59TK1ilsWwqF1G-Wg2OYds&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=ZNg5UtS_Ou6v4AO91oGgBQ&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Hynek%20contacted%20me%20once%20about%20my%20story%22%20Deke&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deke!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was when I was doing a maintenance test flight like this that I had my one and only encounter with an unidentified flying object.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was up about the middle of one afternoon--a nice sunny day--wringing out this particular 51. I had just come out of a spin at around ten thousand feet over the Mississippi River, near Prescott, where the Mississippi and the St. Croix meet, about twenty-five miles from the Twin Cities. I was heading back to Holman Field when all of a sudden I saw this white object about my altitude, at one o'clock.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I didn't think anything about it. My first thought was that it looked like a kite. But logic said nobody's flying a kite at this altitude. So I started kind of watching to see what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was closing on it, but I still didn't think too much about it. The closer I got, the more it looked like a weather balloon, and I'm thinking, that's what it's gotta be. Then I flew past it a little high, about a thousand feet off. It still looked like a three-foot-diameter weather balloon to me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My guess on the dimensions couldn't have been too far off. I had plenty of gas, so I figured I'd make a pass on it. Burn some gas and have a little fun. I pulled into a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But when I came out of that turn and headed straight at it, all of a sudden it didn't look like a balloon anymore. It looked like a disk on edge!
  I thought, that's strange. Then I realized I wasn't closing on that son of a bitch. A P-51 at that time would cruise at 280 miles an hour. But this thing just kept going and climbing at the same time at about a forty-five degree climb. I kept trying to follow it, but he just left me behind and flat disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wondered what that was, but I never saw it again. I turned around, headed back, and landed, and didn't tell anybody about it for two days. I was afraid they'd think I'd lost my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A couple  of evenings later I was over in the O-club with my boss, a full colonel, and after I &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; couple of beers I thought I'd better tell him, and I did.
  He said, &quot;Get your ass over to Intelligence in the morning and give them a briefing.&quot; So I did. They sat there and nodded and took notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then they told me: Just for your information, the day you saw this object a local company was flying high-altitude research balloons. They had a light airplane tracking it, and a station wagon on the ground. Both observers were watching this balloon and had seen this object come up beside the balloon. The object appeared to hover, then it took off like hell.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The guys on the ground tracked it with a theodolite, and they'd computed the speed at four thousand miles an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert White&lt;/strong&gt; - a US Air Force astronaut who acheived suborbital spaceflight by X-15 on 17 July 1962&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sole Encounter - UFO sighting in 1962&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=jV_63sZBUg8C&amp;amp;pg=PA125&amp;amp;lpg=PA125&amp;amp;dq=time%20magazine%2027%20july%201962%20robert%20white&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=yZ8Fqn4nJ5&amp;amp;sig=wMRNbtYoct8MZXsHJRRNuSa7wuA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=s9s5UoWeDtTF4AOOg4G4Cg&amp;amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=time%20magazine%2027%20july%201962%20robert%20white&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Belief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[T]est pilot Robert White is reported as exclaiming in flight 'There are things out there. There absolutely is'. This certainly sounds impressive. However, Good omits to describe what White was talking about. So I had to go to the reference (&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine, 27 July 1962). This revealed that White was talking about an object looking 'like a piece of paper the size of my hand'. This is hardly strong evidence for UFOs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mars has a surface field strength of maybe a few tens of nanoteslas. That's less of a magnetic field strength than a cassette tape. To make things worse, there isn't one single magnetic field, but a collection of weak remnant fields. Mars used to have a global magnetic field a few billion years ago, but today the remaining local fields barely even cover their relatively small areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the components are easy enough to access, but the number of people doing the construction is a limiting factor--could I do it with 5? 10? Any number less than 100 (at which point the line between an organization and a DIY effort is blurry)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is possible to get the components and construct the vehicle with a few people, would it be possible for this small effort to control the construction enough to keep the risk factor manageable?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="20815"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Could you? Well, maybe. Let's take a look at one instance where people were encouraged to do that very feat, for $10 million. I'm of course talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://space.xprize.org/ansari-x-prize&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ansari X-Prize&lt;/a&gt; of 10 years ago. This did a few things that were difficult for the time, giving a cash incentive, and helping with some of the permits and other required items to make it happen. Most of the teams were small, but the winner, Scaled Composites, was larger than your criteria. To date, no one has matched this feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so what could you do with a large budget, but on your own? Well, you would first need some sort of a life support module. These are fairly readily available, given some work. Next you would need a large rocket engine and fuel tank, again, fairly easy. The rocket fuel would be a problem, as is somewhat humorously demonstrated in the movie &quot;Astronaut Farmer&quot;. While I doubt that the project could have actually been built as depicted in the movie, I believe that the government wouldn't care much, until it came time to fuel and launch the rocket. The permit would be challenging as well, it's not easy to get a permit to fly a model rocket to 100,000 feet, and to reach space, you'd have to be even higher. Re-entry gear would be problematic as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is, you might be able to do it, but it would be a fairly risky enterprise, especially considering the modeling that goes it to most vehicles today prior to launch. But it could be done, given some work, knowledge, and a whole lot of cash, and a bit of luck with the government not getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been done to an extent in the form of SpaceX, a fairly successful company founded by a billionaire who had to get to space. Elon Musk funded most of the early development, and the company no doubt will someday launch a person in to space, in to orbit. A similar feat has been tried by Jeff Bezos with his company Blue Origin, focusing on sub-orbital missions. It seems likely that Blue Origin will succeed someday as well.  Although both of these aim to be commercial companies, it seems more likely that both are just a way to get people to space by really rich people.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;One theory is that long ago the mesas were craters that got filled with lava. Once the lava solidified, floods eroded the land around the lava trap, creating a mesa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. James B. Garvin, former Chief Scientist for NASA, the mesas could also have been carved by glaciers or wind, or pushed up by tectonic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Here is a basic rundown of the effects of the shutdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;97% of NASA was furloughed. That is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slate_labs/2013/10/federal_government_shutdown_agencies_with_the_most_furloughs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the highest percentage&lt;/a&gt; of any agency listed. The only known NASA direct operations are those related to Mission Control, and astronauts on the ISS. Everything else was shut down completely.&lt;/li&gt;

This is really good news as they are the primary contacts for the deep space probes. Since the money to keep things going has already been appropriated, they can operate normally.  (Source: Shutdown FAQ dated September 27, 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/ShutdownFAQs-09-27-2013-Update.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;[PDF]&lt;/a&gt;.) There is some evidence that things are still working in this department, for instance, HiRISE recently released pictures of the comet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.universetoday.com/105223/this-is-comet-ison-seen-from-mars/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ISON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single hardest hit to NASA right now is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av038/131001shutdown/#.Uk2ABn9jHSg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MAVEN&lt;/a&gt; has stopped being prepared for launch in just a month an a half. Working in the space business, I can almost guarantee that the last month and a half are extremely critical. The launch window is 3 weeks long, so in theory, a 2 week delay won't have significant impact, but if the launch window is missed, the orbiter will have to be put in to storage and &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/2246/25&quot;&gt;wait another 26 months&lt;/a&gt; until launch. However, it was announced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av038/131003resumption/#.Uk61jn9jHSg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;October 3rd&lt;/a&gt; that access to the MAVEN crew would be granted, allowing them to continue work, with only 3 lost days resulting.&lt;/li&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;As we don't have any direct measuring tools to measure the effects of tectonics (e.g. Mercury-quakes) and not have observed volcanism in the short while that we have been properly observing the planet - we can only surmise what tectonics have and are occurring by observing the surface features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the past tectonic features and dynamics is a means to understanding the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, an important distinction, it appears, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.earth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/korenaga12b.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plate tectonics and planetary habitability: current status
and future challenges&lt;/a&gt; (Korenaga, 2012), that &lt;em&gt;plate&lt;/em&gt; tectonics is a feature unique to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the chapter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~fnimmo/website/Mercury_Chapter.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tectonics of Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, the mostly &lt;strong&gt;compressional&lt;/strong&gt; tectonic features &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A combination of tidal despinning and thermal contraction may
  account for equatorial N–S and polar E–W trending lobate scarp thrust faults
  in the regions by reactivation of normal faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Local preferred orientations of the lobate scarps and uniform thrust slip dip
  directions suggest regional-scale stresses influenced the formation of the thrust
  faults. The wrinkle ridges in smooth plains outside of the Caloris basin are
  likely due to loading and subsidence of volcanic material that flooded lowland
  areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent observations discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blaustein.eps.jhu.edu/~jhr/research/Michel_etal_2013_JGR.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thermal evolution of Mercury as constrained by MESSENGER observations&lt;/a&gt; (Michel et al. 2013), determined that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;that the planet’s core is larger than previously estimated. As Mercury’s
  mantle layer is also thinner than previously thought, this result gives greater likelihood to the
  possibility that mantle convection is marginally supercritical or even that the mantle is not
  convecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this data in simulations, they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;demonstrate that mantle convection can persist in such a thin mantle for a substantial
  portion of Mercury's history, and often to the present, as long as the mantle is thicker than
  ~300 km. We also find that magma generation in Mercury’s convecting mantle is capable of
  producing widespread magmas by large-degree partial melting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MESSENGER also observed large, compressional fold structures and further systems of thrust faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarise, it appears that the tectonic activity on Mercury has been and is from a number of dynamic sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidal de-spinning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contraction as the core cools - reactivating older faults borne from past impacts and earlier tectonic activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, possibly due to some mantle convection that might exist, hot spot activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;A chapter from the reference 'Colonies in Space' (Heppenheimer, 1977, 2007): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nss.org/settlement/ColoniesInSpace/colonies_chap09.html&quot;&gt;Up on the Farm&lt;/a&gt; discusses as the chapter title suggests - farming the food needs of any colony.  Specifically, they discuss which type of livestock is the most viable given constraints of space and feed, specifically for meat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The colonists will also want meat and this poses a problem. Is it feasible to raise meat in the space farm, when space in the farm is at such a premium? The ideal animal must have high productivity. For instance, if you have a herd of cattle, only 20 percent of its mass can be harvested as meat per year. But chickens and rabbits reproduce so fast and grow so rapidly that a herd of either animal can produce five times its initial weight in edible meat over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for dairy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is the question of which ruminant to choose. The two most common milk-producing ruminants are the cow and the goat. Cows weigh ten times as much as goats and eat ten times as much feed. But a cow will produce only four times as much milk as a goat. For a given amount of feed, a goat will produce more than twice as much milk as a cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially, cows are out, goats chickens and rabbits are in.  This is mainly due to the space required to not only house them, but the space required to grow specific food for them.  This in a way, rules out domesticated pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a twist to the final point about space colony pets, the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://ezinearticles.com/?Spiders-Will-Make-Great-Pets-for-Space-Colonists&amp;amp;id=6408683&quot;&gt;Spiders Will Make Great Pets for Space Colonists&lt;/a&gt; (Winslow), suggests spiders may make great pets - they've been taken in space before and did fine (maybe not for everyone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of waste plant material could be decomposed by the use of fungi (which are neither plant nor algae), namely mushrooms, according to the thesis &lt;a href=&quot;http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/61315/3/02chapters1-4.pdf&quot;&gt;Colonization: A Permanent Habitat for the Colonization of Mars&lt;/a&gt;, which in itself would provide another food source.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I was able to find a few requirements for CubeSats that are based upon its integration into a larger system which includes a primary payload (all instances of &lt;strong&gt;primary payload&lt;/strong&gt; are bolded in quotes below, emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CubeSats shall not present any danger to neighboring CubeSats in the P-POD,
  the LV, or &lt;strong&gt;primary payloads&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;2.2.1.3 Absolutely no pyrotechnics are allowed inside the CubeSat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ok1mjo.com/all/ostatni/space_aircraft/CubeSat_specifikace_CDS_rev11.pdf&quot;&gt;CubeSat Design Specification rev 11 - California Polytechnic State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No electronics shall be active during launch to prevent any electrical or RF
  interference with the launch vehicle and &lt;strong&gt;primary payloads&lt;/strong&gt;. CubeSats with
  rechargeable batteries shall be fully deactivated during launch or launch with
  discharged batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Placard: The payload and canisters may be integrated several months or years ahead of launch. A placard informs the LV of the contents, provides traceability, and reaffirms conformance to a specification giving the LV and &lt;strong&gt;primary payload&lt;/strong&gt; assurance of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This brings up
  another requirement, which is the CubeSat must be powered down while in the P-POD so it will
  not interfere with the &lt;strong&gt;primary payload&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &quot;Placard&quot; section in &quot;An Advanced Standard for CubeSats&quot;, we get the impression that the primary payload team and the CubeSat team do not necessarily work closely together, but that the CubeSat teams are given requirements to ensure that the CubeSat does not interfere with the primary payload.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There aren't very many places a mutineer could go...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, for a combination of practical and logistical reasons, the ISS has never held its original planned crew of 7, and instead has been crewed by 3 people for virtually all of its service life, the exceptions being Shuttle and Soyuz visits, either for crew changes or to install or maintain parts of the station. The upshot is that, while privacy is still at a premium, it is possible, if necessary, for a crewmember to distance themselves from the rest of the crew for a while to cool off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an actual FTFO should occur, as a violation of the ISS Code of Conduct, the ISS Commander has the authority, under the ISS Crew Disciplinary Policy, to deal with the situation as he or she sees fit. Certain doors in the ISS can only be opened from one side, so the other two crewmen could, after subduing the mutineer, lock him in the Progress capsule or a similar small, outlying module of the station while a longer-term plan is hashed out with the ground. As far as actually subduing a lone mutineer, the ISS drug cabinet, if it's anything like previous space missions, will have Demerol available, which is one option; another is simple brute force, though a zero-G wrestling match aboard the ISS is likely to damage some very expensive equipment, and there really isn't any good way for any combatant to get the necessary leverage needed for something like a punch, to say nothing of a body slam. As far as we know there are no weapons aboard the station, and it would make little sense to have them; one errant shot could depressurize the entire station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; further to another question - &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/2431/how-is-the-iss-equipped-to-deal-with-the-outbreak-of-a-contagion&quot;&gt;How is the ISS equipped to deal with the outbreak of a contagion?&lt;/a&gt; - I found that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceref.com/iss/medical.ops.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ISS operations guide&lt;/a&gt; indicates that &quot;acute psychosis&quot; and &quot;suicidal thoughts or actions&quot;, each of which would create a potential situation for mutiny and threat to the entire crew, are considered medical emergencies. For exactly these types of emergencies, the ISS medical locker contains Haldol and Valium in both oral and IM-injectable forms. Procedures further recommend restraining the crewmember by wrapping his extremities with duct tape and/or bungee cords, then stowing the person in their sleeping bag. There are no cases on record of these drugs or procedures ever being needed in orbit, but someone obviously thought ahead and considered the possibility of someone unexpectedly going off the deep end in a closed capsule hundreds of miles from help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the entire crew were to mutiny, and attempt to do something that jeopardized the station, Mission Control can lock the crewmembers out of most station systems and run the thing on autopilot. There really isn't anything else &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; do, until the next Soyuz heads to the station with the crew replacement. That would likely not happen until Mission Control has regained some semblance of control over the crewmembers aboard the station, and that in turn would involve measures up to and including the withholding of critical supplies, such as food and water (and water is used to make oxygen by electrolysis). The ISS crew simply must cooperate with the ground in order to do almost anything of value to the crewmembers or the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the options for dealing with a crazy person aboard the space station are very limited, and for that reason, astronauts are very carefully chosen, and team chemistry monitored closely during training. Dealing with multiple crazy people, however, is rather simple; lock down the station and wait them out. I can't imagine anything approaching a true mutiny by the crew of the ISS ending well for any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;NASA, ESA, and RSA follow very conservative policies towards sending a potentially infected person into space. All the blood tests and other screenings in the days, weeks, and months leading up to a launch would make it virtually impossible for an astronaut to carry a communicable disease up to the ISS without showing symptoms or being detected as an asymptomatic carrier (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_Mary%E2%80%8E&quot;&gt;Typhoid Mary&lt;/a&gt;), either of which would have the astronaut grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, astronauts have gotten sick in space. Obviously, motion sickness (or zero-g sickness) is a common problem, but it's not caused by an infection. It's more akin to seasickness, caused by a combination of your lunch constantly churning around in your stomach as you move, and conflicting inputs from sensory organs like your inner ear that are a gravity-dependent indicator of &quot;up&quot;. For that, there are and always have been barf bags aboard spacecraft, of continually increasing sophistication. Antiemetic drugs are a newer additional measure, but as the primary side effect of most such drugs like phenergan is drowsiness, they're saved for the worst of the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, worst, and only publicly-known episode of a communicable disease spreading aboard ship was Apollo 7, in which the mission commander, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Schirra%E2%80%8E&quot;&gt;Wally Schirra&lt;/a&gt;, gave a rather nasty head cold to his two crewmates. The resulting breakdown in order aboard that craft (it was an eleven-day flight, the second-longest thus far and the first manned flight of the Apollo capsule, so there were several SNAFUs relating to the crew's supplies and accommodations on top of the illness) ultimately resulted in all three astronauts being permanently grounded (it was Schirra's last flight anyway, but Cunningham and Eisele had been in line for Moon landings). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo 7 also made NASA flight doctors &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; skittish about infections; the original prime crew of Apollo 13 included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard&quot;&gt;Alan Shepard&lt;/a&gt;, but an ear infection caused NASA medical staff to switch his entire crew with Jim Lovell's. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Mattingly%E2%80%8E&quot;&gt;Ken Mattingly&lt;/a&gt; was famously scrubbed from the Apollo 13 crew three days before the launch due to exposure to measles. Ironically, he never got sick, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Haise%E2%80%8E&quot;&gt;Fred Haise&lt;/a&gt;, as was popularized in the movie, brought up a non-contagious urinary tract infection on that same flight, and without any antibiotics in the medical kit to treat the infection, he was in considerable pain and suffering during most of the mission and for weeks after landing. It's not known whether the mission would have been scrubbed anyway due to his illness; by the time the worst of his symptoms manifested, the accident that crippled the Odyssey had already occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not been able to uncover any other instances of astronauts contracting an infectious disease while en route to or aboard the station, but the ISS does have measures in place for illnesses and other ailments, similar to other U.S. space missions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceref.com/iss/medical.ops.html&quot;&gt;Medical Operations section&lt;/a&gt; of the ISS &quot;user guide&quot;. In it are the following tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The various procedures in this guide infer that the ISS has a small pharmacy aboard in its drug cabinet, containing several options each for analgesic pain relievers, antihistamines, decongestants, antiemetics, anti-diarrheals, sleep aids, etc up to the &quot;hard stuff&quot; like cortizone and albuterol steroids, opioid painkillers including hydrocodone and possibly morphine (it's mentioned in drug interaction warnings but no procedure says to administer it), antibiotics, antifungals, and even a local anesthetic (Lidocane/Xylocaine) and two anti-psychotics/anti-anxietals (Haldol and Diazepam/Valium), each of those in oral and injectable form. Procedures detail the dispensing of these drugs for a variety of symptoms and presentations including those associated with common communicable illnesses (sinus blockage, cough, vomiting/nausea, fever, headache, rash, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stays aboard the ISS are long-term, and 31 of the total 88 ISS crewmembers to date have been women, the medical kit includes such sundries as the anti-fungal drug fluconazole for yeast infections, and - hand to God - &lt;em&gt;pregnancy tests&lt;/em&gt;. Apparently this made the news in 2001, when this medical procedures document was first leaked, as it represented NASA's first tacit acknowledgment that some of its astronauts might try to join the &quot;200-mile-high club&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, due to the long duration of ISS missions, various conditions that would otherwise be treated very primitively with first-aid measures on a moon shot or Shuttle flight instead have procedures and supplies for a more lasting fix; these conditions include everything from broken bones and concussions to kidney stones and dental cavities. The kit includes tools and materials specifically to perform dental repairs such as crown replacements, cavity fillings, bracing/securing of cracked teeth, and extractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;I know from a few previous questions that some pretty strong drugs are available aboard different spacecraft and the ISS. Have any officials ever determined, on record, that drugs have been abused?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Since the best information we have is quoted from a news article, this is going to be an exercise in speculation and deduction. First, let's assume &quot;a high degree of accuracy of less than 10 meters&quot; puts the possible spatial resolution range at 10-30 meters or so (note: I'm going on the assumption that the use of the term &quot;accuracy&quot; is just typical misreporting, and what they're really referring to is &quot;resolution&quot;). What does this buy you? The below image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satimagingcorp.com/characterization-of-satellite-remote-sensing-systems.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this nifty website&lt;/a&gt; will help visualize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HzfTv.png&quot; alt=&quot;spatial resolution&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while there are certainly things larger than a house that are of military interest, this will not exactly provide you with detailed intelligence - you could do much better with Google Maps, for instance, whose high-resolution imagery is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/11410&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;1 meter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... what's the point? Well, there are plenty of other things you can do with satellite imagery. The SPOT-5 satellite has similar resolution, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/spot-5.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;is marketed as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a key asset for applications such as medium-scale mapping (at 1:25 000 and 1:10 000 locally), urban and rural planning, oil and gas exploration, and natural disaster management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be collecting &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multispectral_image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;multispectral imagery&lt;/a&gt;, you can do even more interesting things, particularly in the name of science. NASA's &lt;a href=&quot;http://glcf.umd.edu/data/landsat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;LANDSAT&lt;/a&gt; imagery is of even lower spatial resolution, but is very information-rich, as it does not include only visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small size of Iran's satellite (&amp;lt;50 kg according to the article) indicates that it may be more of a technology demonstration mission as opposed to a large, mature, operational system, which makes sense. While a domestic satellite imagery capability is obviously of interest to a country like Iran, there are no doubt several other components, systems, and processes that will be demonstrated, all in the name of technological maturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt; today, I've heard an interesting suggestion that the rate of deterioration in astronauts' vision might also be linked to what the interviewed scientist Scott Smith, a nutritionist and one of the authors of the recent study from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hacd/laboratories/nutritional-biochemistry-personnel.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;NASA's Johnson Space Center's Nutritional Biochemistry Lab&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;dependent one-carbon metabolic pathway&lt;/em&gt;. I've been curious to see what that could mean, so I've ended up on this NASA's page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/vision_changes.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;New Findings on Astronaut Vision Loss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All About the 1C Pathway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let's break this down: The human body is
  like a machine, with many chemical processes taking place to keep
  cells functioning, which in turn keep the body functioning. These
  chemical processes use specific pathways to do their job. Everyone has
  these pathways. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The one-carbon pathway is part of the chemical process the body uses
  to make DNA, or genetic instructions. The pathways are similar to an
  assembly line in a factory. If the pathway is not working properly, it
  gets behind or backs up. This is what happens if there is a vitamin
  deficiency. Since astronauts participate in dietary and nutritional
  assessments, researchers were able to rule out common vitamin and
  nutritional deficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Enzymes are the workers on the assembly line, and can have different
  forms -- little changes or variations that occur -- between
  individuals. These multiple forms are known as polymorphisms. As
  humans evolve, tiny changes in DNA occur resulting in multiple forms
  of enzymes. A good example of polymorphisms is blood types -- though
  blood is blood, there are differences that account for a variety of
  blood types. Lactose intolerance is another example of polymorphisms
  in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because, as Smith said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;We now need to go another step forward to assess whether it is a
  small piece among many others, or a large piece that is a primary
  cause of this problem. Not only may the results have significant
  implications for NASA and future astronauts, but the implications for
  the general population could be profound.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he also points out that these results, while very exciting, are preliminary and said that the next step will be to directly test for the presence of enzyme polymorphisms to verify whether this relates to the vision changes. The mentioned article is from May 2012, and as we see from the attached photograph, new expedition crew members (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_38&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Expedition 38&lt;/a&gt;) continue to perform ultrasound eye imaging tests and I imagine all kinds of other tests pre, during and post flight to support research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question here is, has 1C pathway been successfully linked to ocular health of astronauts or have any other findings come out of NASA's research in vision deterioration of astronauts onboard the ISS since May 2012?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I don't think technology is preventing us from living on the Moon or even Mars at this point. I think budget and time are the main limitations--the time it takes to execute a mission to start a base on another world, not time to wait for new technology. Improved technology could help us come up with solutions to some of the budget and time hurdles--and make the entire enterprise a safer bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the longer we wait, the more data we will have about those environments which will allow us to be more efficient in where and how we build a base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that neither lunar nor martian colonies have to be self-sustainable. Resupply missions can take place, and improved technology will also help our resupply missions be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Bigelow Aerospace Inc. sought permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to claim property on the moon for lunar mining. Bigelow's legal staff had advised that the FAA is the place to start asking for permission, while the FAA insisted that they have no jurisdiction over spacecraft--despite their involvement in launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Dunstan of Mobius Legal Group claimed that the FAA has no authority over the moon, and likely would not make a determination on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in December 2014, &lt;strong&gt;they did&lt;/strong&gt;. In a letter to Bigelow, the FAA stated that they intend to &quot;leverage the FAA’s existing launch licensing authority to encourage private sector investments in space systems by ensuring that commercial activities can be conducted on a non-interference basis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have pointed out that both officially and practically speaking the FAA has no jurisdiction outside of the U.S. To clarify what role the FAA is playing, the author of the letter to Bigelow told the press:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We didn’t give (Bigelow Aerospace) a license to land on the moon. We’re talking about a payload review that would potentially be part of a future launch license request. But it served a purpose of documenting a serious proposal for a U.S. company to engage in this activity that has high-level policy implications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, then, the FAA will probably not exert much more control over space than they already do, but in the short term they are going to do what they can to work with commercial companies to bring greater visibility to the issues of commercial space.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.space.com/6972-steve-squyres-robot-guy-humans-mars.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;good authority&lt;/a&gt; (Steve Squyres, principal investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know, I'm a robot guy, that's what I have spent most of my career
  doing, but I'm actually a very strong supporter of human spaceflight.
  I believe that the most successful exploration is going to be carried
  out by humans, not by robots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What Spirit and Opportunity have done in 5 1/2 years on Mars, you and
  I could have done in a good week. Humans have a way to deal with
  surprises, to improvise, to change their plans on the spot. All you've
  got to do is look at the latest Hubble mission to see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there may be some constraints which derive from planetary protection concerns, in particular protecting Earth from putative Martian organisms that the crew might bring back outside of sealed sample containers.  From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NASA's Design Reference Architecture&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In order for humans to explore Mars and return to Earth safely, it
  will be necessary to identify sites on Mars that are free of hazards
  to the Earth’s biosphere. This is because astronauts on the martian
  surface inevitably would be exposed to local martian materials such as
  dust, and the plan is to return the astronauts to Earth at the end of
  the mission. The astronauts are therefore a potential vector for the
  transport of martian dust, which must be shown in advance to be
  sufficiently safe. The Space Studies Board has recommended the
  designation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10360&amp;amp;page=6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zones of Minimum Biological Risk (ZBRs)&lt;/a&gt; that are
  regions demonstrated to be safe for humans. That is, astronauts would
  only be allowed in areas that are demonstrated to be safe. For the
  initial landing site, such testing would probably have been performed
  as a part of the precursor mission activities, which may include
  analysis on Earth of returned martian samples, particularly wind-blown
  dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same planetary protection concerns require the protection of Mars habitats from human-borne microorganisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The strategy that was adopted for the current DRA envisions targeting
  the human landing site that would be located within an area that is
  already known to be safe to humans (a zone of minimum biological risk)
  and in which microbial contamination would be permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If humans have to avoid the very thing we might be looking for, it would put into question why we would send them.  If such constraints cannot be avoided, a human expedition might be limited to the search for evidence of life in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="3120" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Looking at one of the latest images of Titan's north pole as taken by Cassini probe made me curious how well equipped this NASA's probe actually is to detect non-water-based exobiology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rmp2y.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;Titan's lakes from T-96 pass: cb3, grn, bl filter. Processing: 2di7, titanio44 (Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ridingwithrobots.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Riding With Robots&lt;/a&gt;, raw data: &lt;a href=&quot;http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;NASA/JPL&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories for possible life on Titan are conveniently presented on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page on Life on Titan&lt;/a&gt;, and while Titan is in Earth terms extremely cold (surface temperature is about 90 K, or −179 °C, or −290 °F), possibility of its environment sustaining non-water-based life isn't dismissed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Titan appears to have lakes of liquid ethane or liquid methane on its surface, as well as rivers and seas, which some scientific models
  (still tentative and debated) suggest could support non-water-based
  life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has also been suggested that life may exist in a sub-surface ocean consisting of water and ammonia. Recent data from NASA's Cassini
  spacecraft have strengthened evidence that Titan likely harbors a
  layer of liquid water under its ice shell.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Titan is the only known natural satellite (moon) in the Solar System that is known to have a fully developed atmosphere that
  consists of more than trace gases. Titan's atmosphere is thick,
  chemically active, and is known to be rich in organic compounds; this
  has led to speculation about whether chemical precursors of life may
  have been generated there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The atmosphere also contains hydrogen gas, which is cycling through the atmosphere and the surface environment, and which living things
  comparable to Earth methanogens could combine with some of the organic
  compounds (such as acetylene) to obtain energy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this naturally begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How well equipped is Cassini to detect non-water-based life, traces of metabolic byproduct gases in Titan's atmosphere of such life forms, and other local environmental changes of non-water-based biota? Which of its many sensors are particularly suitable for this and have any observations to date shown evidence of unexplained local fluctuations in atmospheric composition, fluorescence or surface thermal characteristics, perhaps around areas of Solar terminator or edges of its Saturn-facing side during Titan's librations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.e. what would we be looking for with sensors Cassini has available to it during one of its many flybys of Titan, if we were looking for possible signs of non-water-based life on it?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the Huygens probe already delivered us some data about the possibility of methanogenic life on Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane
on the surface of Titan&quot; by McKay and Smith, they discuss many effects that methanogenic life might have on the surface of Titan that the Huygens probe would pick up. One of these is a reduction in the levels of $H_2$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If bacteria are consuming complex hydrocarbons at the surface of Titan, the observable effects might include: complete consumption of $C_2H_2$ at the surface, reduction in $C_2H_6$ and organic solids at the surface compared to the accumulation expected from photolysis alone, and a sink of hydrogen at the surface creating a gradient in the hydrogen mixing ratio with altitude. All of these effects may be detected and measured by the Huygens probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Huygens probe, in fact, did detect a reduction in $H_2$ at the surface. The $H_2$ signal hovered between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; counts per second throughout the atmosphere, but at the surface it was clearly below 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; counts per second. I'm not qualified to assess whether this reduction is significant, but I imagine there are many professionals poring over this data, trying to extrapolate what they can from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering this data gathered by the Huygens probe that Cassini already dispatched and ongoing data gathered by Cassini on each flyby, I would say that Cassini is certainly well equipped to help us detect life on Titan. As with any instrument, however, it requires a substantial degree of human interpretation of data so it may be a while before we can draw any real conclusions. And it may be that we determine that we need to send other instruments to bolster our results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, we may have humans celebrating the first Christmas on Mars of all time. Since this is such a big milestone in the history of Christmas, it would be unfortunate if Santa Claus couldn't deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;If the search for life on Mars is a particular concern, I think putting boots on the ground would be devastating (or bring smashing success, depending on your perspective). When we send robotic probes to Mars, we do our best to send them sterile so as to not contaminate our search. If we send human beings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-humans-carry-more-bacterial-cells-than-human-ones&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;which contain far more microbial cells than human cells&lt;/a&gt;, there is no chance of avoiding contamination. We would wear space suits while out on the Marian surface, but we can't put those suits on without smudging millions of bacteria all over them. Maybe before we step out, we bathe the outside of the suit with bleach and radiation, but the chances are approximately zero that we will always be able to guarantee a clean suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, if we go there ourselves with all of our dirty biology, I can guarantee you that we will find life. Even if Mars is barren today, once we arrive, life will find a vector to escape from its human host to the Martian soil. Now, in the long term, I think that's a good thing. I don't think a barren planet is as valuable to the Universe as one where life is growing and evolving, but of course, I'm very biased, being alive. But I do think that if we want a clear-cut answer to whether life already exists on Mars, we need to conclude our search before we send living explorers. It's certainly possible even after our arrival to find fossil evidence that predates our arrival or to prove distinction of a Martian genetic strain, but without a doubt, the core question of life on Mars becomes more complicated and difficult once we contaminate the site, and it casts doubt on anything that we might hope to find. And I can just imagine the articles that our descendants may one day write about how our generation hastily flubbed the search for life on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (yes, everything from here down):&lt;/strong&gt; Mark Adler has pointed out in comments below that I have not made clear how contamination would be a problem. Thank you Mark. You're right. I see 4 varieties of life that we might discover on Mars which, by their nature, would each have vastly different degrees of similarity to Earth-life: 1) Completely independent Martian evolution. Probably not even DNA-based. 2) Seeded by galactic or intergalactic &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;panspermia&lt;/a&gt;. If this turns out to be a real thing, Earth would have been similarly seeded. 3) Branched from Earth during the last couple of billion years (Think impact ejection dispersal; not Cambrian spaceships.) 4) Brought by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, depending on your philosophy, you may be tempted to scoff at one or two of the possibilities I have mentioned. But I ask you to consider the fact that nothing has been or can be proven yet about the feasibility of these proposed sources for life, or even which is most likely. So far we have no scientifically admissible and conclusive evidence that life exists outside of our little spheroid, which is precisely why this question is so important on Mars and anywhere else we explore. So if you scoff, it is a philosophical scoff, not a scientific one. (Please correct me if you can prove anything contrary.) I'm not as worried about missing a variety 1 discovery through contamination, but missing varieties 2 and 3 would be every bit as tragic a loss, and we just don't know how easy it might be to miss. Imagine &lt;em&gt;actually finding them&lt;/em&gt;, but then later in peer review not being able to prove that they didn't come from Earth through contamination, because they are so similar to Earth life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of contamination, whatever little Earth bug manages to thrive in a place like Mars will likely be pretty unique. The creatures that we have found in the least Earth-like places on Earth, places like the Yellowstone caldera, are not your standard garden variety e coli. They are still recognizable as Earth life, but remember, we need to be able to distinguish them from Martian life variety 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to hope that our Earth muck would not spread nearly as successfully as any existing Martian bugs growing in their home habitat. Our bacteria ought to need millions of years to adapt as well as the Martian native life. And if some Terran extremophile did manage to start spreading relatively quickly through the subsurface of Mars, we could take that as evidence that there was nothing native to Mars before our arrival, because clearly if any lifeform can spread like this, why wasn't Martian life all over the place and easy to find before this contamination event? &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt;, it may be that our biota is simply so wealthy with genetic variety due to the ideal planet we developed on that it is better armed to crush the sparse native Martian population under it's heel, and we will never even know it was there. If we could have found it, yes, we might have been able to distinguish it from Earth life, but it will be exterminated in short order by our invading bacteria in this scenario. If something like this did occur, I tend to favor the probability of the former explanation to the latter, but again, no scientific experiment can actually &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that. We have only philosophical conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst case scenario is that there is life on Mars and the life we are looking for is of variety 3 - It's originally from Earth and therefore somewhat similar to potential sources of contamination. Then contamination occurs and doesn't look like anything we've seen before, because it's a rare little beastie. And then worse, it ends up spreading much more successfully than the uncommon Martian life that is there already. Finding native life at this point would be worse than looking for fireflies while the forest is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how, you may ask, could the contaminant species possibly be more successful than the Martian species that have the advantage of eons in the Martian environment, but are otherwise similar (from Earth)? I would expect that it would not be, from my perspective in an absolute vacuum of actual scientifically tested knowledge on the subject. However it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be that the advantage of eons on Mars is dwarfed by the advantage of the species that hitched a ride to Mars not on the molten embers of an exploded planetary surface at the point of some massive impact event which then cooled to temperatures that made Mars seem tropical by comparison and then drifted, degrading gradually, for many millions of years before then barely surviving &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; hot impact event on the surface of its new home, but instead inside a nice temperate wet human with a spaceship that provides such an incredibly safe and quick ride that even the over-sized eukaryote manages to survive and then do &lt;em&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/em&gt; after his/her arrival. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may notice that I have claimed that there is little we can prove, that we can only guess at what might be out there and what could happen during contamination, then I painted a relatively specific picture of what I would hope to avoid. So recognize that I'm not warning that this great bad thing &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; happen if we send people too early. I'm pointing out the risk of what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; happen. And I see no good way to accurately measure that risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://phys.org/news/2016-10-year-old-viking-life-mars.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was published at phys.org today (Oct 21, 2016). The final paragraph corroborates the primary point of my answer, as these experts in the field express concern about the spoiling of the pristine Martian environment even by remote landers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concerns I raised here would also be significantly validated if what they found with the LR experiments turns out to truly be biological: They describe the hypothesized microbe as fragile (very sensitive to temperature fluctuation at least). Thus, if it does exist, it may be easy to inadvertently exterminate.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Let's first get a few boring details out of the way, then we'll see if we need to tell Santa to add a detour to Mars to his 2025 schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There won't be any children on Mars by 2025 with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/en/faq-en/21-faq-selection/251-do-i-qualify-to-apply&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;minimum applicant age requirement of 18 years&lt;/a&gt; by end of August 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/en/mars-one-news/press-releases/11-news/495-deadline-approaching-ten-days-remain-to-join-aspiring-martians-from-140-countries&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;deadline for Mars One online application program&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The astronaut selection program will be open for applicants who are 18
  years or older. This is the age by which children become legal adults
  in most countries in the world. Mars One believes it is important that
  applicants who enter the astronaut selection program are capable of
  entering into a legal contract without the supervision of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that even if Mars One is capable of following its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/en/mission/summary-of-the-plan&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;road map&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest first permanent settlers on Mars will be no less than 30 years of age (in Earth years, see below) by Christmas 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to answer more directly, if &lt;em&gt;Santa Claus is coming to Mars in 2025&lt;/em&gt;, we have no way of confirming that, short of establishing that so far, till December 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mars One project&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/en/mission/summary-of-the-plan&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;on schedule according to set roadmap milestones&lt;/a&gt;. The application program has ended and here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://applicants.mars-one.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;searchable list of all the applicants&lt;/a&gt; with links to their profiles and introduction videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Santa Claus will have to keep in shape until 2025, with 12 complete and worldwide Christmas deliveries of presents to all the well behaved children around the globe first, then the same, plus a &lt;em&gt;quick (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Distance%20from%20Earth%20to%20Mars%20on%20December%2025%202025&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;at least 40 minutes long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)* detour to Mars to deliver present there in 2025 to a bit older children, too. How old? Since Martian year lasts whole 2.135 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_year_%28astronomy%29&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Julian years&lt;/a&gt;, some of the first settlers might be as young as 14 years of age in Martian terms by Christmas 2025. So it looks like we will have to make sure to notify Santa of this fact before planning his worldwide presents delivery route for 2025. It should indeed be the very first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noradsanta.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Santa's Interplanetary Presents Delivery&lt;/a&gt; (SIPD). ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;Approximate location along the Earth's terminator (dividing line between day and night) when Santa might have 40 minutes to spare&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;* Assuming the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt; in vacuum, the theoretical maximum speed at which information  in the universe can travel. Since we know that Santa Claus is real and has a physical presence, he cannot move any faster to Mars and back (20 minutes in each direction). That shouldn't stop him from delivering all the Christmas presents to all the children in the world too, tough. He does have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Santa%27s_helpers&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the best helpers&lt;/a&gt; available to him to help him achieve that. And there is just about 40 minutes of one Earth day available in his schedule during Christmas, because not all the Earth's globe is populated by children and there might be a bit of space in his schedule when the Christmas evening reaches Pacific.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Christmas on Earth is essentially a winter solstice holiday. Its date was fixed based on the Roman winter solstice (a southern solstice) which was December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Southern solstice is the time of the year when the sun is at its southernmost point in the sky. It is independent of hemisphere, whereas winter/summer solstices are north/south dependent. All winter solstices in the Northern hemisphere are southern solstices.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only makes sense that if Santa is doing Christmas on Mars once a Martian year, that he would also use the Martian southern solstice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130516125740/http://pweb.jps.net/~tgangale/mars/mst/WinterSolstice.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a chart of winter solstice times on Mars from 1875 to 2127. It appears that the next winter solstice on Mars after Mars One is scheduled to arrive is April 25, 2026. I assume that these are southern solstices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is when Santa plans on delivering gifts to Mars, this will give him plenty of time after Earth's Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the possibility that Santa will continue to use December 25 because of its convention. If this is the case, he will have to abandon his plans of only visiting Mars once per Martian year.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Besides the issues already mentioned, it's also caused some morale problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike what user6972 claims, we did not have 'vacation'.  Some were designated as essential employees, and were required to work through the shutdown.  Some were sent home, but unlike with a vacation, you couldn't really go anywhere as you might be called back at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was designated as essential-on-call.  This meant that I was required to check in daily to see if there were any emergencies that I needed to respond to, and in one case, I had to actually go into the office to correct a problem that I couldn't deal with remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has also resulted in some significant morale issues, as we kept getting conflicting reports from our contract management about what we were or weren't allowed to do remotely.  As our task is staffed by personnel who work for three different companies, everyone got different information; even within the same task, some people's duties were considered essential, others not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're sitting in a waiting game -- only the civil servants were paid for their time off.  Those of us that are contracts are still waiting to hear months later if we're going to have to burn through weeks of leave to make up our time, or if the government's going to pay us for the time.  We've been told that it depends on the terms of the contract, and that each contract will have to be evaluated separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term affects won't be known for some time ... and that is, how many people decide to leave NASA and federal work in general so that they don't have to go through this again?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The Venus ionosphere would definitely not be destroyed. Ionospheres are formed by interaction between the atmosphere and the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The UV radiation is more intense closer to the Sun, so Earth-like atmosphere on Venus would probably have even &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;amp;context=physics_facpub&quot;&gt;denser&lt;/a&gt; ionosphere than actual Earth has. Venus receives 1.9-times the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html&quot;&gt;irradiance&lt;/a&gt; in compare to the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ionosphere on terraformed Venus could be even thicker than it is now. The UV radiation does not currently penetrate deep into the Venerian atmosphere due to its immense density. It would get much deeper if the atmosphere was less dense. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlr.de/me/Portaldata/25/Resources/dokumente/strahlenbiologie/astrobook/P3_14.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on page 229. This could ionize thicker layer of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is of course what would be the actual electron density (and its altitude profile) and whether it would be greater or smaller than currently on Venus. Today Venus has maximum electron &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#Upper_atmosphere_and_ionosphere&quot;&gt;density&lt;/a&gt; in its ionosphere about $ 3.10^{11} m^{-3} $. &lt;a href=&quot;http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/22203/1/97-0670.pdf&quot;&gt;Earth ionoshpere&lt;/a&gt; electron density peak is about $ 1.5.10^{11} m^{-3} $ which is half of Venus, so in fact it is comparable. We may be tempted to think that closer to the Sun the density in Earth-like ionosphere could be bigger. But density varies wildly over altitude and what exactly would happen with Earth-like ionoshpere electron density profiles at Venus is hard to estimate - I am not aware of any such study. Anything could happen, because there are many effects: atmosphere density, depth of UV penetration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Venus does have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/InducedMagnetosphere.pdf&quot;&gt;induced magnetosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it is weaker than Earth magnetosphere, but it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Significance_of_solar_winds&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; provide partial protection against the solar wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this would still not stop stripping of the terraformed Venus atmosphere by Solar wind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;A short answer is no, Venus wouldn't lose its ionosphere if the target state of terraforming is matching Earth's atmospheric composition, temperature and pressure. The long answer is a bit more interesting though, particularly why that is a problem, and not a solution to Venusian lack of magnetic field. Let's first address the first point, and I'll slowly progress towards the problem parts;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionosphere isn't anything special, it's something we should expect on any celestial body that's close enough to its star and holds lighter elements exposed on their surface, if it's initially having atmosphere or not, for its topmost layers to interact with the star's high energy proton flux and electromagnetic radiation. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/14nov_lunarionosphere/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Moon has ionosphere&lt;/a&gt; because, while its exosphere isn't dense enough for its molecules to interact with each other, they still interact with the solar (photo and/or ionizing radiation induced) charged lunar surface. We also see this interaction with comets and their surface activity increasing as they cross the Solar system's snow line roughly somewhere in the middle of the main asteroid belt's distance to the Sun. Actually, it doesn't even take being close to any star and this interaction will in the long run be sufficiently provided by cosmic rays, it will only take longer for much of the pressure above the celestial body's surface to form, and the total pressure won't be sufficient for us to call it &lt;em&gt;an atmosphere&lt;/em&gt;, if it's then constantly being blown away by solar winds or the body isn't massive enough to hold onto these ions gravitationally or by strong force, say surface tension or electrostatically. E.g. we'd likely call it &lt;em&gt;an exosphere&lt;/em&gt; since its pressure wouldn't be sufficient for released particles to interact between each other like we'd expect them to in &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; atmospheres (where density is high enough that its constituent elements, atoms, molecules or more complex and heavier particles frequently collide with each other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever source of interaction with high energy atomic and subatomic particles, or source of strong electromagnetic radiation like e.g. UV, gamma, et al., or even beta particle radiation, when they hit a molecule of weaker valence, they will cause their molecular bonds to break and atoms themselves to lose electrons, or rarer, even lose protons. In essence, they will ionize, and area of atmosphere that holds this proton gradient, where lighter, more energetic positive charge particles float over the remaining byproduct of such interaction, their heavier negative charge anions, is what we'd usually call an ionosphere. This is where Venus gets its weak electromagnetism of its ionosphere from. Now, most of its atmosphere is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and there isn't much in a sense of extremely light ions forming, such as we'd expect if there were molecules of water in the upper atmosphere, at first splitting into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. And that's a problem, if terraformed Venus wouldn't have its own magnetic field. Let's inspect how Venusian interaction with solar wind looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ji58L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interaction of Venus with the solar wind&lt;/strong&gt; (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_images.asp?id=7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Venus: The veiled planet&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image, Venus is capable of sustaining thick enough plasma sheet in its magnetotail to act with its proton gradient as weak magnetic field, holding onto most of the now charged / ionized upper atmosphere that's been pushed away from it by the solar winds. This is possible because most of these ions (cations for positive charge ions and anions for negative charge ones) are heavier atoms with sufficient number of electrons orbiting their nuclei for this proton gradient to be relatively strong and countering their kinetic force as they're accelerated by interaction with high velocity proton flux of the solar winds. So Venus is able to hold onto most of its atmosphere and the rate at which it loses it to strongest interactions, such as being directly hit by a coronal mass ejection or a solar flare is slower than it is able to replenish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes a huge problem with magnitude thinner Earth-like atmosphere that also contains light elements, like hydrogen in water molecules. The magnetotail would compose of fewer and a lot lighter elements, including H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and they would be blown away from Venus, losing great deal of its terraformed to be suitable for us atmosphere. So unless you can sustain this terraforming process that made it habitable in the first place and match loss of atmosphere, or kickstart a magnetic field on Venus to lower this interaction rate, or even somehow block or deflect the inbound solar wind, lower atmosphere would weaken and lose pressure to outer space. Ionosphere would still be there though, slowly sucking the denser lower atmosphere until it's own depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the source of my now deleted comment that this question can only be sufficiently answered if you included means of terraforming Venus. One of the main problems with that is getting rid of most of its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and one way to do that is by pumping enormous amounts of hydrogen into its atmosphere, preferably with addition of metallic (iron, cobalt or nickel) catalyst to &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; it into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosch_reaction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bosch reaction&lt;/a&gt;, where end result is atomic carbon and water: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. But whichever mode of terraforming would be chosen, if end state is to match Earth's own atmosphere (or come close to), and the planet to contain bodies of water, significant part of its atmosphere would be water vapor. And hydrogen bonds aren't strong, and water &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; to lose one of its hydrogen atoms even with relatively weak interaction with colliding high energy particles and UV radiation. So the ionosphere would end up being too big for comfort, magnetotail would be weaker (less dense than now and with weaker, single electron carrier ions, less electromagnetically attractive) and planet would start losing its atmosphere faster. But it wouldn't lose its ionosphere, it would replenish through lower atmosphere while there is any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

Reproducing a quick, most relevant excerpt from it here for easier reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interpreting what is happening in Venus's ionosphere requires
  understanding how Venus interacts with its environment in space. This
  environment is dominated by a stream of electrons and protons – a
  charged, heated gas called plasma -- which zoom out from the sun. As
  this solar wind travels it carries along embedded magnetic fields,
  which can affect charged particles and other magnetic fields they
  encounter along the way. Earth is largely protected from this
  radiation by its own strong magnetic field, but Venus has no such
  protection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What Venus does have, however, is an ionosphere, a layer of the
  atmosphere filled with charged particles. The Venusian ionosphere is
  bombarded on the sun-side of the planet by the solar wind.
  Consequently, the ionosphere, like air flowing past a golf ball in
  flight, is shaped to be a thin boundary in front of the planet and to
  extend into a long comet-like tail behind. As the solar wind plows
  into the ionosphere, it piles up like a big plasma traffic jam,
  creating a thin magnetosphere around Venus – a much smaller magnetic
  environment than the one around Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="4063" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;The question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/2835&quot;&gt;Interstellar eavesdropping&lt;/a&gt; points out that we have been broadcasting to space for a long time, currently we are approaching a century.  This means every star system in within 100 light years has had the opportunity to become aware of Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course technical issues in receiving and translating our broadcasts, particularity across light years, I am allowing those issues to be the subject of different questions.  This question focuses on the size and membership of the broadcast sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many star systems have our broadcasts been exposed to? What will the exposure be as time goes on? (i.e. another 100 or 1,000 years).  Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exoplanet&quot;&gt;exoplanets&lt;/a&gt; we have discovered so far how many are in our broadcast sphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the average number of confirmed exoplanets per star system, there are about 140 exoplanets total within 100 light-years in confirmed planetary systems. I won't list the rest of them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use the same average across our estimated number of stars, we arrive at about 17,500 exoplanets in 100 light-years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some rogue planets within 100 light-years which aren't even considered in any of these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in another 100-1000 years, there will be practically countless planets in our sphere of broadcast influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting, eight out of the 93 discovered exoplanets within 50 light-years are potentially habitable. If this same ratio extended out to our 17,500 estimate, that would mean about 1,500 potentially habitable planets within 100 light-years.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;From the technical definition of drugs, and your definition of abuse I can say I've been told of alcohol 'abuse' on the ISS. Abuse is a strong word, though; a celebratory drink was had when there was a crew change a while back; not what I would call abuse but it was 'taken when not needed'. There's even a picture out there on the internet somewhere of the crews at the time of the changes with the bottle! (I believe it was cognac.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="4305" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;We have seen in these questions that one of the primary concerns in sending humans (or anything for that matter, but especially humans) to Mars is contamination of the Martian environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any Earth biota were to get muddled into the Martian environment it might adversely affect our search for life on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch Mars One mission is not primarily intended to search for life, but regardless it is still a manned mission to Mars. Do they plan to take any precautions to prevent contamination? I ask because they are not affiliated with existing space agencies, so the current restrictions do not apply to them. If they do have a process  planned already to prevent contamination, what does this process entail (in brief)?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There is an official Mars One FAQ page &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/faq/mission-to-mars/will-the-mission-be-harmful-to-mars-environment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;answering exactly this question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mars One will take specific steps to ensure that the Mars environment
  (which we will study, and on which we will depend) will not be harmed.
  The Mars base will be forced to recycle just about everything, and pay
  close attention to its energy use and minimize the leakage of
  materials and energy. Nutrients are scarce on Mars. They either need
  to be imported from Earth, or extracted from the ground or atmosphere.
  Solar panels, which will also be launched from Earth, will generate
  the settlement's electricity. All of this means that a Mars resident
  will have a much smaller ecological footprint than that of the average
  person on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition, the development and operation of the settlement itself
  can greatly improve our sustainability efforts on Earth. The necessity
  to recycle everything on Mars will provide a high-profile boost to our
  recycling industry, as will the demand for lightweight solar panel
  technology. New methods of cultivating crops and growing plants on
  Mars can also teach us on Earth a great deal about how to improve our
  environment from experiences on another planet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention of environmental contamination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mars One will take the required actions to prevent environmental
  contamination caused by the importation of Earth life (humans and
  their companion organisms). Mars One has begun discussions with the
  ICSU Committee on Space Research’s (COSPAR’s) panel on planetary
  protection and the COSPAR panel on exploration to identify the
  measures that need to be taken with respect to prevent this
  contamination. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/about-mars-one/advisers/christopher-p.-mckay-phd-usa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Chris McKay&lt;/a&gt; of the COSPAR panel on exploration and
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mars-one.com/about-mars-one/advisers/prof.-john-d.-rummel-phd-usa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prof. Dr. John D. Rummel&lt;/a&gt; of the COSPAR panel of planetary protection
  are two of our advisers. Based on discussions with these two panels,
  Mars One will acquire the necessary systems and take the required and
  necessary actions to protect Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, this FAQ question is a reply to one of the questions to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tw2fy/i_am_bas_lansdorp_cofounder_of_marsone_mankind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bas Lansdorp's AMA&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. Or perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TePLtbTzzZ0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mars One press conference&lt;/a&gt; held in Washington DC in December 10, 2013. I'll update, if I find some more info on it. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Once you open the hatch, Mars is contaminated. No matter how hard you try to sterilize everything before opening up, there will be microbes on the outside of suits, airlock surfaces, etc. Maybe you could flood the airlock with hot acid or some other biocide and then drain it, but that will be considered too much useless payload, and is not 100% guaranteed anyway. There's a good chance that some stuff has already made it to Mars on landers (that we attempted to sterilize) and crashed orbiters, so we'll never be absolutely certain that any bug we find there is truly native (unless its biochemistry is radically different from anything on Earth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we can do is hope that the chemical environment of Mars's surface is so harsh that no Earth life could survive there. That doesn't bode well for the survival of astronauts or settlers, who will track some surface materials into their living quarters and breathe it in. I just wish people weren't in such a rush to get to Mars, and would do some more robotic looking for life on and below the surface (and sample returns), before people get there and definitely contaminate it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The nematode, or roundworm, known as &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, is able to reproduce fully in space from mating through development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though simple, the nematode &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an animal and it is one of the most studied creatures on the International Space Station. I am not aware of any other animals that have been observed to successfully reproduce in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the relevant portion of my source material (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ICE-First-Aging is one of several experiments that investigates the effects of space flight on a model organism in the nematode worm family (Caenorhabditis elegans) and aims to develop links to human physiology in space. &lt;strong&gt;The organism chosen for this study is known to be able to mate, reproduce and develop apparently normally during space flight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies have also successfully reproduced in space, and there was an attempt to study the reproduction of geckos in space--unfortunately, the geckos froze at some point during the flight.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, the answer to your question is &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;. As I have explained in answer to a related question (&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/4513/what-animals-if-any-have-reproduced-in-space&quot;&gt;What animals, if any, have reproduced in space?&lt;/a&gt;), nematodes are able to experience a full reproduction cycle in space. Nematodes &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; considered pregnant at a point in this cycle, and their pregnancy does meet your definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Egg and Sperm join, Cells divide and attach to the uterus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously nematodes are not mammals, and though some are ovoviviparous, the species observed in space is not. I am not aware of any mammals that have been observed to get pregnant in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of animals on the space station has been very popular with the public to the extent that the Onion, the satirical &quot;news&quot; source, saw fit to make up their own animal for the ISS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/articles/mischievous-raccoon-wreaks-havoc-on-international,1180/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mischievous Raccoon Wreaks Havoc On International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that some animals, such as dust mites, have gotten on board outside of study purposes. Dust mites were known to inhabit the Mir space station and other space missions. Current allergen studies on the ISS have not involved the detection of dust mites.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the claims made was: &lt;em&gt;&quot;The Russian segment [of ISS] can exist independently from the American one. The U.S. one cannot.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside all the political considerations of whether any of this is a good idea, is this claim true? Can the US side not survive on it's own? Why was such a design made so that it couldn't survive but the Russian side could?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="5405"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;What is being referred to here is the fact that the guidance, navigation, control, and propulsion capabilities of the ISS are entirely contained in the Russian &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MMBQ1ol.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ISS Diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA does have a module on the ground that is capable of replacing the &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; module temporarily for three years called the Interim Control Module, but the US currently has no way of delivering this to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6wLw4xj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interim Control Module&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have designs for a long term module to replace Zvezda, but the design was never approved and is now outdated and would need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; was originally designed to be part of a successor to the Russian Mir space station, but was gifted to the International Space Station as part of a good faith effort between Russia and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why there is a strong reliance on &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; today. The US had plans to backup the &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; module, but they were not needed at the time, since &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the political situation is concerned, if the Russian government really did break faith with the US in this way, it might be enough impetus to reignite the space race. With the proper budget (which a reignited space race might provide), the US has ample capability to strike out on its own. There would be political ramifications from this, obviously, and at this time we cannot know how the US, Russia, and the world would be affected by a new space race. It could be good or bad, and likely a mix of both. It may cause an acceleration of technological development, but it could also have nasty side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; alone lack from being a capable space station? Are there any existing Russian modules or modules in development that could be attached to enable it to be a capable space station if it is not already? If Russia detached &lt;em&gt;Zvezda&lt;/em&gt; from the ISS today, approximately how quickly could they have a functioning independent space station?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="460"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Zvezda has crew accommodations, orbital control, docking ports to expand (forward end) and accept refueling (aft end). The docking compartment can be used as an airlock for spacewalks. It is far more complete on its own than any other module in the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, Zvezda is Mir-2. It is the actual Mir-2 module.  Had ISS not occurred, the plan was to use this module to start a new station complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Mir, Zvezda doesn't have Control Moment Gyroscopes (they arrived on Kvant-1). Some work needs to be done to improve communication abilities: Luch-5 satellite relay infrastructure could be utilized more heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Zvezda lacks compared to Mir, is in the forward docking compartment, it only has 3 (or 4 if you count the one attached to Zvezda itself).  Forward, zenith and nadir.  No side ports. This is only an issue as a standalone, as the UM for the future Russian segment is a docking module with 6 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not a lot of room in just the one module, nor a lot of power available, which is why Mir had the various add on modules.  But by itself it could probably do a good job as a space station (as many Salyut stations and Mir did before it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens the Russian plan is to use the Nauka MLM module, due to be launched and docked to the earth facing (nadir) port on Zvezda, along with the UM docking ball (6 ports, so lots of options), and the Solar Power platform to form the core of a new station.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="4950" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;I was recently rereading this previous question of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/2372/what-would-happen-if-a-mutiny-occured-on-the-international-space-station&quot;&gt;What would happen if a mutiny occurred on the International Space Station?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was considering different contingencies, the thought occurred to me that Mission Control locking out the crew members from the systems might not be effective if the ISS is &quot;hackable&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the unlikely scenario in which the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) decides to mutiny and ally with China. Mission Control locks out the crew from the controls, but then the crew hacks the ISS to regain control. China, as their partner, promises to send resources in lieu of the regular deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is impossible for the crew to regain control from aboard the station, but there is another possible scenario: someone hacks remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider in the above unlikely scenario if instead of the crew hacking the ISS, China hacked remote control of the ISS in cooperation with the mutinied crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is either type of &quot;hacking&quot; the ISS possible? If so, how difficult would each be to pull off?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="7026"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Communications_and_computers&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; contains some information about the computer systems which control the ISS. Short version is: it is a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, some modules have their own systems and communication frameworks. Internally, WiFi is used. The &quot;key systems&quot; are documented to run Debian Linux, while they previously used Windows -- which means that these systems are basically PC, and run common operating systems. As such, they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; also have the same vulnerabilities. I also expect that they don't get patched for security fixes on a regular basis. So the bottom-line is that the ISS should be highly &quot;hackable&quot; -- provided that the attacker gains some access to the communication network of the ISS. Hacking into the ISS from the ground would imply penetrating one of the two communication networks which link the ISS to the external world (the American &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TDRSS&quot;&gt;TDRSS&lt;/a&gt; and the Russian &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lira_%28ISS%29&quot;&gt;Lira&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-board astronauts should find it easy to take full control of the ISS systems, because it is highly improbable that these PC are physically shielded (shielding is weight, and weight is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive when talking about orbital things). Also there is a big Tradition in human space exploration (and human exploration in general) to keep the local human in control of things -- that's the reason why we send humans and not chimpanzees in orbit. In that sense, the ISS crew cannot &quot;hack into&quot; the ISS computers because they already have full control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining control of the ISS system would not buy much to any attacker. At best, they could spread some local mayhem, probably kill the crew or threaten to do so if some ransom is not paid (e.g. by swinging the robotic arm into the hull, or sabotaging the oxygen inflow, or using the the ISS orbital control engines to precipitate it down to the atmosphere, or playing some Britney Spears at full volume in the audio system). Though an atmospheric reentry may fail to burn the complete station, targeting a precise area with the debris seems overly difficult, and the impact energy would not be high, so a subverted ISS would not account for a plausible orbital bombardment weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize: hack into the ISS, yeah, but what for ? It is not a boat; it cannot be made to land anywhere. Its strategic military value is nil. The ISS is good for Science and Public Relations, but very useless otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Is there any coordination between governmental space agencies in order to achieve complementary science goals with interplanetary and other space missions?

For example, are ESA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Express&quot;&gt;Mars Express&lt;/a&gt; orbiter and the ISRO's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Orbiter_Mission&quot;&gt;Mars Orbiter Mission&lt;/a&gt; really complementary with two NASA orbiters already there? Is the ESA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExoMars_Trace_Gas_Orbiter&quot;&gt;ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; to be launched in 2016 really an added value to the NASA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN&quot;&gt;MAVEN&lt;/a&gt; (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission) launched in 2013? Would NASA have considered doing those missions on its own if no one else had? Do they fit rationally into the grand plan of Mars exploration? ESA has also followed NASA to Venus and Mercury. And now NASA considers to follow ESA's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moon_Explorer&quot;&gt;JUICE&lt;/a&gt; mission to Jupiter's moons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA and ESA both have fairly diversified mission portfolios. But taken together, they seem to overlap a lot. JAXA's asteroid and comet missions, however, I think can fit with those of NASA and ESA because of the variety of the targets and big differences in mission profiles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa&quot;&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_%28spacecraft%29&quot;&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28spacecraft%29&quot;&gt;Rosetta&lt;/a&gt;). And Russia at least aims for the moons of Mars, rather than yet another Mars orbiter or rover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5023/would-colonising-antarctica-be-a-good-test-for-colonising-mars#comment13675_5023&quot;&gt;Would colonising Antarctica be a good test for colonising Mars?&lt;/a&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This isn't a direct answer, but I think colonising underwater would be a better practice for colonizing Mars. Some problems are reversed in direction (you're trying to keep water out rather than air in), but the challenges are similar: you can't breathe outside and have to take precautions going in and out, reduced sunlight of similar length, isolation both physical and communication-wise (assuming there isn't an undersea cable), and unusual hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we had a manned capsule that could dive into the depths of the ocean at a controllable rate. What acceleration would it need to maintain to simulate Martian gravity within the capsule?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the capsule were diving to the deepest point in the ocean (roughly 7 miles or 11 km), how long would the inhabitants have in the simulated Martian gravity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the capsule could also ascend at a controllable rate. If it turned around at the deepest point and ascended, how much additional time would this give in simulated Martian gravity before reaching the surface? I would think it would double the time, but I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Fluid resistance and with pressure and temperature changing viscosity of water would limit such tests to a rather short distance, depending on your acceptable margin of error. Unless you're able to constantly adjust buoyancy / rate of descent, and somehow overcome challenges of eventually hitting terminal velocity of your test apparatus in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without it, and assuming ability to dynamically adjust buoyancy on descent, I get nearly exactly 60 seconds till the depth of 11 km at 6.096 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Earth sea-level gravity of 9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, minus Mars standard datum gravity of 3.711 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is roughly how much of Earth's gravitational acceleration you need to remove to simulate that of Mars. Remember, we're still on Earth (well, slowly descending deeper into it, but 11 km isn't all that much compared to Earth's equatorial radius of ~ 6,378 km), so those 9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; didn't disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, your capsule would reach in 11 kilometers of free fall at Martian gravity over 366 m/s, which is above Mach 1 at mean sea-level Earth's standard atmosphere. So you'd have to employ some heavy drag reducing techniques, say a series of implosions in front of your capsule (on a parabolic trajectory) that would help if fall through it easier. I have no idea how to achieve that and keep capsule's acceleration more or less constant. Perhaps by installing a 11 km deep tube that had water evacuated and you replace it with some less dense (and inert, we don't want implosions at such depth!) gas. At such immense pressure (up to 1,100 atm), it would have to be quite a tube though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the ascent part though, you can't really do it. Your capsule's proper acceleration vector is negative to Earth's gravity, so all the forces combined within it don't partially cancel acceleration effect of Earth's gravity out, but add to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This was not the first instance of malware being transported to the

  Russian astronaut had brought a laptop running Windows XP that was
  infected with the W32.Gammima.AG worm which quickly spread to other
  systems running the same operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an attacker manages to infect an astronaut's PC with a malware, it can easily be transported to the space station and since the space station uses known operating systems, infection is plausible. The challenging part might be to cause physical damage without knowing the details about the hardware and the control systems but that won't be a problem if it's a state sponsored espionage but like Thomas Pornin said, there is no point in doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

Until 2024&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows the ISS annual operating costs at $2.9 billion. How much of this cost can be linked to the fact that the ISS has a human crew? It takes a lot to support a human crew in space: more mass to launch in resupply, launches to ferry crew back and forth, life support systems, higher risk monitoring, etc. If it is possible to separate these costs out, I would be very interested in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Some users have mentioned that estimating this depends on what you count and what you don't. Let's imagine that Robonaut were completely capable of performing solo operations on the ISS, and that Robonaut has now been given full responsibility for performing all on-board activities on the ISS. How would this change the annual operating cost? (Don't try to estimate what it would take to maintain Robonaut at this level of activity--assume current Robonaut costs whether those are lower or higher than they would be in this imaginary scenario.)&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="5543" AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;Obviously, with no humans living permanently off-planet yet, Earth-style dates and times are the most common system is use, and reasonably so.  And it helps that Mars's day is almost the same length as Earth's, so even Martian colonists could use roughly a 24-hour day.  (I was always charmed by the idea in the Mars Trilogy of simply stopping the clocks at midnight for a 38-minute &quot;witching hour,&quot; a sort of half-hour Mardi Gras every night, which would become a bit of local cultural flavor for people visiting Mars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, when substantial numbers of people are living on the Moon and on Mars and on Venus and on ships in between, etc, a 24-hour day and 365-day year will be an increasingly irrelevant timescale.  There will probably need to be a &quot;stardate&quot; or some other interplanetary date/time system that is standardized across all planetary bodies, and even later, all solar systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few systems exist today that could work, such as Unix timestamps, but often these measure such small increments (like seconds) that they are better for use by computers than by people.  But at some point, a person on Venus will need to say to a person on Titan, &quot;it happened back in February,&quot; and I can't imagine that learning the complete calendars of every planetary body will be the most practical option.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="12038" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Each crew member of the ISS gets care packages on cargo flights. In a video tour of the station, it was mentioned that each crew member has a stash of favorite food just for them. It is easy to see how such a comfort could be very useful on a tough day. My impression from the video is that this is actually officially mandated, that each person have a store of such foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess that is part of what goes in care packages. What other things are sent up? What is the size and mass allotment for such cargo? How much of care packages are sent by family and friends, and how much is assembled by the space agency of that crew member?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="14855" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently announced plans to send a probe, named al-Amal (Hope), into Mars orbit. A new group called the Emirates Mars Mission was created to head this effort. The Emirates has insisted that they want this to be more than a technology demonstration mission. As such, they have stated certain science goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once there, its work will include analysis of the Martian atmosphere in hopes of finding answers to ongoing conundrums involving Mars’ long term water loss via atmospheric photo-dissociation. That is, the reactive chemical breakdown of water (H2O) brought on by the Sun’s incoming photons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Its mission aims include observing clouds and dust storms; changes in atmospheric layers and for the first time how the atmosphere interacts with Mars’ varied topography, from the large shield volcano Olympus Mons to the deep canyons of Mars’ Valles Marineris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;after being inserted into an elliptical 55-hour orbit in the first quarter of 2021, Hope will carry out its nominal two-year science mission at altitudes ranging between 22,000 to 44,000 kilometers. From there, the mission will investigate how the lower and upper levels of the Martian atmosphere are connected. One goal is to create the first global picture of how the Martian atmosphere changes throughout the day and between seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Science Lead for the mission is Sarah Amiri, who seems to have experience in technology, but not in planetary science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xIt2G.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sarah Amiri&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The other moons orbit around both Pluto and Charon, so in a way it is accurate to say that they orbit the Pluto-Charon system rather than just Pluto, since Pluto and Charon orbit a center of gravity outside of Pluto. For now, the IAU has not pursued classifying Pluto-Charon as a double planet, so the moons are all said to be satellites of Pluto.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don't know how to measure atmospheric pressure, so I cannot discriminate on that basis. Initially my answer only included unmanned missions, but based on suggestions I've decided to add the Apollo missions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first landers performed intentionally hard landings and did not get pictures from the surface. I want to include them because they were the first man-made objects to land on The Moon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luna 2 (Soviet Union - impacted 13 September 1959)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranger 4 (USA - impacted 26 April 1962)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranger 6 (USA - impacted 2 February 1964)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranger 7 (USA - impacted 31 July 1964)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranger 8 (USA - impacted 20 February 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranger 9 (USA - impacted 24 March 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first attempts at soft landings failed, but they still did land (crashed) on the surface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luna 5 (Soviet Union - impacted 12 May 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luna 7 (Soviet Union - impacted 7 October 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luna 8 (Soviet Union - impacted 6 December 1965)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unmanned Missions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first successful soft landing was made by the Soviet Union's &lt;strong&gt;Luna 9&lt;/strong&gt; mission. It landed on the Lunar surface on 3 February 1966 and lasted for six days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USA had its first successful soft landing shortly after with its &lt;strong&gt;Surveyor 1&lt;/strong&gt; mission. It landed on 2 June 1966 and survived for 65 hours:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/61OuL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Surveyor 1&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luna 13&lt;/strong&gt; was the next lander to make it to the Lunar surface. The Soviet lander landed on 24 December 1966 and survived six days.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveyor 3&lt;/strong&gt; was sent by USA and landed on 20 April 1967. It was also the only lander (so far, as of May 7, 2018) to be later visited by astronauts. Its mission lasted about 14 days.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveyor 5&lt;/strong&gt; landed on the Moon on 11 September 1967. Its mission lasted 65 hours.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveyor 6&lt;/strong&gt; landed on the Moon on 10 November 1967. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1967-112A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;NASA's website&lt;/a&gt;, Surveyor 6 was put in hibernation mode on 26 November 1967. It was awakened on 14 December 1967, but no useful data was received, and communication was permanently lost that day.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveyor 7&lt;/strong&gt; landed on the Moon on 10 January 1968. It performed its mission collecting images and scientific data until the mission was put on hold on 26 January 1968 because the lunar day had ended where the lander was. The mission resumed on the following lunar day on 12 February 1968 until the mission ended on 21 February 1968.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luna 16&lt;/strong&gt; was the next successful (unmanned) mission to the Moon. It landed on 24 September 1970 and survived for 12 days. This was the first successful robotic mission that returned a sample from the Lunar surface. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1970-072A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;NASA's website&lt;/a&gt; says that according to an observatory in Germany, good quality pictures were sent back from Luna 16, but those images were never made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Luna 17/Lunokhod 1&lt;/strong&gt; mission was the first rover mission. It landed on 17 November 1970, and the mission continued for 322 days.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luna 20&lt;/strong&gt; was another sample return mission. It landed on 21 February 1972 and returned to Earth on 25 February 1972.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Luna 21/Lunokhod 2&lt;/strong&gt; mission sent another rover to the Moon. It landed on 8 January 1973 and survived 146 days.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luna 24&lt;/strong&gt; was the final mission sent in the Luna Program. It landed on 18 August 1976 and returned a sample to Earth on 22 August 1976. I haven't yet found an image taken by Luna 24 on the surface, and from what I've been able to gather so far it doesn't seem as though it was equipped to take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chang'e 3&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Chinese lander to make it to the Moon, and the first soft landing since 1976. It landed on 14 December 2013. The lander survived for about a year, but the rover only survived for about three months. This picture was taken of the lander by the rover:

&lt;h3&gt;Apollo Missions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo 11&lt;/strong&gt; was the famous first manned landing on the lunar surface. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on 20 July 1969, were the first two people to step foot on the Moon. Michael Collins was the other astronaut in this mission.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo 12&lt;/strong&gt; landed on the Moon on 19 November 1969. Charles Conrad Jr, Richard F. Gordon, and Alan L. Bean were the three astronauts on this mission. Conrad and Bean were the two astronauts to walk on the surface during this mission.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo 14&lt;/strong&gt; landed on 5 February 1971. Alan B. Shepard Jr, Stuart A. Roosa, and Edgar D. Mitchell were the participants in this mission. Shepard and Mitchell were the two astronauts who walked on the surface.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo 15&lt;/strong&gt; landed on 30 July 1971. David R. Scott, Alfred M. Worden, and James B. Irwin participated in this mission. Scott and Irwin walked on the lunar surface, and they were the first to drive a NASA lunar rover.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mercury&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messenger&lt;/strong&gt; did technically land on Mercury, although it was a hard landing. I want to include it because it is the only thing we've sent to the surface of Mercury, and although it didn't take pictures &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the surface, it did take pictures &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; the surface.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Soviets are the only ones who ever successfully performed a soft landing on Venus, and they were successful in several Venera and Vega missions. NASA also sent two orbiters to Venus as part of the Pioneer project. The second orbiter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/pioneer_venus.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pioneer Venus Multiprobe&lt;/a&gt;, included four probes (one large, and three small) that were deployed to analyze the atmosphere. The large probe was deployed on 16 November 1978, and the three small probes were deployed on 20 November, 1978. While these probes were not meant to be landers, one of the small probes did survive the impact with the surface and continued to transmit information for more than an hour before it perished. They were not equipped with cameras, so they took no pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 15 December 1970, The Soviet Union had its first successful landing on the surface of Venus with the &lt;strong&gt;Venera 7&lt;/strong&gt; mission. It was the first successful soft landing on another planet. &lt;strong&gt;Venera 8&lt;/strong&gt; landed on the surface of Venus on 22 July 1972. Neither of these missions returned any images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venera 9&lt;/strong&gt; landed on the surface on 22 October 1975, and returned the first image from Venus. This was the first image ever sent back from the surface of another planet.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venera 11&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Venera 12&lt;/strong&gt; landed on Venus on 21 December 1978 and 25 December 1978. They were equipped to take images, but their lens covers did not separate, so images were not taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venera 13&lt;/strong&gt; landed on Venus on 1 March 1982. It was the first mission to return color images from the surface of Venus.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union sent the first three missions that landed on the surface, but because of complications none of them returned complete images &lt;em&gt;(Mars 3 did attempt to return &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Mars_3_Image.png/800px-Mars_3_Image.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;an image&lt;/a&gt; (Wikipedia) that some consider to be of the horizon, but it was unintelligible. On the subject, Wikipedia says &quot;According to the Soviet Academy of Sciences there is nothing, horizon or otherwise, identifiable in the photograph&quot;)&lt;/em&gt;. These missions were &lt;strong&gt;Mars 2&lt;/strong&gt; (27 November 1971), &lt;strong&gt;Mars 3&lt;/strong&gt; (2 December 1971), and &lt;strong&gt;Mars 6&lt;/strong&gt; (12 March 1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Viking 1&lt;/strong&gt; lander was the first to send back images from the surface of Mars. It landed on 20 July 1976 and survived for 1824 days.

It was deployed from Mars Express on 19 December 2003 and was scheduled to land on 25 December 2003, but communication with Beagle 2 was never established. The most current explanation is that the solar panels did not deploy properly. Because the communication equipment was housed below the solar panels, Beagle 2 was unable to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; landed on Mars on 3 January 2004 and survived 2269 days.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galileo&lt;/strong&gt; was a probe that studied several bodies in the solar system, especially Jupiter and its moons. On 7 December 1995 it sent an atmospheric probe into Jupiter, and on 21 September 2003 it was sent into Jupiter as well. While these technically weren't landings, it's about as close as you can get on Jupiter (Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/5041/10234&quot;&gt;TildalWave's answer&lt;/a&gt; on a question about standing on the &quot;surface&quot; of Jupiter).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huygens&lt;/strong&gt; was a probe sent to Saturn's Moon called Titan as part of the Cassini mission. It landed on the surface on 14 January 2005. It survived for 90 minutes following the landing.

&lt;h2&gt;433 Eros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mission called &lt;strong&gt;NEAR Shoemaker&lt;/strong&gt; landed on this asteroid on 12 February 2001. What is interesting about this one is that it wasn't even intended to be a lander, but it was the first soft landing on an asteroid. The decision to attempt the landing was made during its nearly yearlong orbit around the asteroid. It survived the landing and continued to operate for about two more weeks. Communication was lost on 28 February 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;25143 Itokawa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/strong&gt; was designed to make a very short landing on the surface of the asteroid so that it could return a sample. It made two very short landings on 19 November 2005 and on 25 November 2005. Hayabusa collected dust and returned it to Earth.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The structure of lettuce is determined by a combination of genetics and environmental effects. What the growth of the lettuce on the ISS indicates is that gravity is negligible in terms of its effect on lettuce growth. Atmospheric pressure would have a more noticeable impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direction in which a plant grows (shoots up, roots down) is determined by light (for leaves) and water source (for roots). The process by which the plant shoot moves toward light is called phototropism, and gravity has negligible impact here. With the roots gravity does have some impact (geotropism), but the ISS project was able to overcome this by using stakes to guide the roots to the water. This water-seeking quality of the roots is called hydrotropism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where gravity would have an impact is in the ultimate height of a plant. Trees are ultimately limited in height by gravity, but if somehow they evolved in a microgravity environment they could potentially grow a lot taller.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map shows the reflectance of the surface of Mars in the methane sensor's reference channel, a wavelength in which atmospheric methane is transparent to infrared radiation. The data that underlie this map will eventually be compared to the methane sensor's other channel, a wavelength in which methane absorbs light, to attempt to map methane at the part-per-billion level in Mars' atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I struggle to understand why there isn't a common design or a standardized structure that space agencies can reuse trying to save costs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it because in such a mission-specific project the costs savings related to using a similar layout are almost none, since most of the efforts are focused on designing specific science instruments rather than the probe chassis?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Rather than establishing a common design for space probe construction, the aerospace industry establishes common standards for &lt;em&gt;managing&lt;/em&gt; construction. This makes more sense with the scope and life cycle of these types of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When probes are rare and have very specific destinations and purposes--and need to be constructed in a cost-managed, timely fashion--you don't want to constrain the design where you don't have to. You want to give the designers the freedom to maximize success for the probe, because often these are one-shot missions--if you fail, you may not get funding for a retry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn't to say that there aren't situations in which it is appropriate to reuse designs. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_2020&quot;&gt;Mars 2020 rover&lt;/a&gt; is planned to use a similar design to the Curiosity rover with different science instruments. Curiosity's design has proven to be effective in navigating the Martian terrain, so it makes sense to reuse parts of the design for another rover. Notice that NASA sent four rovers to more or less the same terrain before they decided to reuse the design. There were a lot of lessons to learn before reusing design made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;According to FAA estimates, European commercial launch revenue was about $920 million in 2014, which was a 30% increase from 2013. This was the second highest of the regions compared after the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNX2x.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNX2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;commercial launch revenues&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAA states the following method was used to derive the estimate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These revenues are assessed based on commercial launch price estimates for each launch vehicle using publically available information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ESA's total revenues for 2013 were about $4300 million. If we assume a similar amount for 2014, then commercial launch revenue would be about 20% of total revenues. This seems to be a reasonable amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we can't compare directly to expenses since the ESA doesn't seem to distinguish commercial and non-commercial costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA's entire Commercial Spaceflight budget for 2014 is $821 million. If the ESA has comparable expenses, then commercial launches are certainly profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

They search for such uploaded videos and make them more accessible this way. Right now there are about 150 such videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However even that is only a smattering of the talks that occurred. ISDCs are huge events, I'd estimate the 25 videos of the most recent one represents maybe 15% of the talks that occurred. Most of those talks were not filmed by the NSS. There were usually 5 or 6 talks happening at any one time, and there weren't enough volunteers to film properly. Proper cameras and often lights were set up in cases where filming was done, and then carted off to other talks. There is no official record of a lot of great talks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;You need to make 550 liters of oxygen in 8 hours.  On average in the paper provided they made about 400 milliliters of oxygen per hour (throwing out the high and low outliers).  That's 3.2 liters per 8 hours. At that rate you'd need 171 times more equipment than they had for this test to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also burned through their electrodes quite often, so you'd need a large supply of these or a way to re-coat them locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd estimate the equipment weighs between 10 and 25 kg. You've got two crucibles as well as heating elements and insulation. You'd get some economy of scale so you'd need between 855kg and 2,000kg per astronaut, assuming a 100% increase in efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also look at CO2 photodissociation.  There's been recent research in using ultraviolet light to fully strip CO2 to C and O2.  It could be more efficient and simpler; however it is recycling vs adding new oxygen to the environment so that may not fit your criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Care packages may be sent up once or twice during a six-month period, and they are usually assembled from items sent from the astronaut's home or from the support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nztaW.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nztaW.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; alt=&quot;ISS crew care package&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package is sent in a half-size cargo transfer bag (CTB) made of white Nomex fabric and 24.8 cm x 42.5 cm x 23.5 cm. The maximum load is 5 kilograms per crew member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NASA article goes into further detail on the content restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bag is also restricted by content. Food is allowed. But, anything with significant crumbs -- such as potato chips and peanuts, depending on the packaging -- that can stray into the air, causing problems with computers and the ventilation, can't go. Homemade treats like cookies -- besides the crumb factor -- can't go, because they're perishable and their quality can't be monitored. Products containing alcohol -- not just alcohol to drink, but alcohol in perfume, aftershave, and mouthwash -- can't go into space, and neither can cans under pressure -- like shaving cream. Clothing can go, as long as it's 100 percent cotton. Certain electronics, like handheld video games, aren't allowed either, due to concerns about batteries (they have sparking potential) and off-gassing problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All objects have to be tested by engineers for off-gassing before being sent up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the picture, each item is sealed in a flight-certified plastic zipper bag before it is placed in the CTB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't specifically addressed, but I would wager that the friends and family of the crew are allowed to submit enough to fill up the package--and that the support staff adds where that is lacking. Though the article does mention that there are certain occasions (like holidays) where psychological support scientists fill the bags with, for example, decorations for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of angles to this question, which is probably why it has taken so long for this post to receive an answer. I'm going to try to break this down into a few different points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. The Title Question&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no single forum for coordinating activities across all space agencies internationally, unless you count the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_Outer_Space_Affairs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose is to facilitate intergovernmental discussions and the use of space technology by developing countries, so it doesn't really get into the realm of organizing an international space exploration strategy (until September 2016, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/17806/58&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Global Exploration Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does, however, exist a Global Exploration Strategy which is advanced by the 14 member agencies of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalspaceexploration.org/wordpress/?page_id=50&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG)&lt;/a&gt;: ASI (the Italian space agency), CNES (the French space agency), CNSA (China National Space Administration), CSA (Canadian Space Agency), CSIRO (the Australian space agency), DLR (the German space agency), ESA, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute), NASA, NKAU (the Ukrainian space agency), Roscosmos, and the UK Space Agency. The Global Exploration Strategy was released in May 2007 and it identified the same need you are pointing to here, an international coordination mechanism. The ISECG was instituted to be that coordination mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISECG holds regular meetings to establish non-binding products and form working groups for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. Duplication Abounds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ISECG products are non-binding, each agency is still free to accomplish its own agenda. There is a strong drive in most states to develop science and technology internally to maintain a competitive advantage against other states. As such, you will see things like ISRO's &lt;em&gt;MOM&lt;/em&gt; and China's &lt;em&gt;Yutu&lt;/em&gt;, which though they have independent purposes, also serve as demonstrations of the national level of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Is the Duplication Worthless?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, though, there is so much data to be gathered and so much development to be done to exploration technology, that it would be hard to assess whether the duplication is really suboptimal. Also, &lt;em&gt;space exploration is risky business&lt;/em&gt;. A little redundancy ensures that progress continues to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

Starliner CST-100 and Dragon are planned to soon allow affordable crewed missions to LEO, and Soyuz could maybe already do it. At least Orion is designed to allow for an EVA, and it is a $bn 8.8 telescope. Even if JWST is not designed to be upgraded, a moving part gotten stuck might be moved manually during an EVA. The upper stage would then bring it to L2. I do think some other spacecrafts have orbited Earth before having set off to their interplanetary destinations. Why won't JWST deploy in LEO where it is potentially serviceable? (like Viking?).&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;Imagine rovers collecting samples on Mars and launching them to dock with a Mars-Earth transfer spacecraft. This vehicle would be in a Mars cycler orbit which passes near Mars and Earth every 7 years, for example. The sample in a cubesat sized probe and put in Earth orbit, possibly landing on Earth. It could also carry terabytes of data in solid memory chips brought together with the rock samples from instruments on the surface of Mars. All being low weight and cheap to accelerate, using the fuel stored in the Cycler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point would be to lower mass and complexity of the Mars ascent vehicle, so that for each return to Earth only one Atlas V class launch, or so, would be required to land it on Mars. Plus the one time larger launch of the reusable cycler. The cycler could provide fuel for Earth orbit insertion of the sample, and during the transfer also solar power, shielding, Earth communication, keeping the samples at Mars temperature if desirable. And maybe a capsule for direct Earth landing (storing one for each return mission foreseen). A sample return mission once every third conjunction (about 7 years) doesn't seem overly ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could sample ascent, Earth landing and cycler transfer vehicles be made light enough to make this feasible today? Or would they need too much overhead equipment? Would the high velocities required for rendezvous with a cycler orbit eat up the benefits?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I think a more efficient method of data transfer would be relay from Mars orbit to Earth orbit. Of course this would involve beefing up both Mars and Earth satellites (most substantially, Mars). Of course, if you're talking about 100 TB of data, then we won't have any quick and efficient means of delivering that for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as sample return, I can't see the need for sample return being that high anywhere in the near future. It is a lot more likely that we'll do more &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; lab work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;could you?&lt;/em&gt; Sure, I don't see any reason why you couldn't have cargo instead of crew. I just doubt a cycler will be set up specifically for data and sample purposes, due to the cost of setup. If you already had a cycler system set up, it might be used for that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not seem that there is much regulation around facial hair. Astronauts are allowed to maintain their own style within reason, and because of the astronaut culture (with many coming from the military) most are clean shaven or have a well trimmed mustache at most. I'm sure that practically there is a length limit, but I doubt there is regulation yet since it probably has not been an issue thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

The second article mentions the only non-training instance when the gun was used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every Soyuz spacecraft carries such a gun, although none of these guns have ever been unpacked in flight. And they have never been needed, with the exception of an incident in 1965, when bears (or wolves—the story varies) chased two far-off-course cosmonauts. The guns are often presented to crew members as postflight souvenirs. Although several survival kit bags have shown up at space auctions, I’ve never seen any of the guns for sale. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The first manned Soviet flight was Vostok 1 in 1961, and the first Soviet flight with a multiperson crew was Voskhod 1 in 1964. The Wikipedia article that you linked intends to say that Soyuz 1 was the first &lt;em&gt;Soyuz&lt;/em&gt; mission with a crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anecdote about the wolves and bears comes from Voskhod 2 on March 19, 1965:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the Soviet crew of Voshod 2 &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt;, their landing back on Earth in an isolated, very snowy forest marked a harrowing start to a new mission: survival. Getting through the ordeal would end up requiring a gun to ward off wild bears, some tricks to staying warm in below zero temperatures and cross country skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voskhod 2 landed off target in the Siberian forest, and according to the account it was in the middle of mating season for the bears and wolves which lived there. Moscow had no idea where they landed for some time, so the two cosmonauts had to survive in the forest until they were retrieved by a rescue team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the full story in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/voskhod-2s-perilous-landing-130321.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Discovery article&lt;/a&gt; I snagged this from. Wikipedia says the landing site was 59°34′N 55°28′E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-hand account captured in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airspacemag.com/space/the-nightmare-of-voskhod-2-8655378/?no-ist=&amp;amp;c=y%3Fno-ist&amp;amp;page=3&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Air and Space&lt;/a&gt; neglects to mention any use of the gun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were only too aware that the taiga where we had landed was the habitat of bears and wolves. It was spring, the mating season, when both animals are at their most aggressive. We had only one pistol aboard our spacecraft, but we had plenty of ammunition. As the sky darkened, the trees started cracking with the drop in temperature—a sound I was so familiar with from my childhood—and the wind began to howl.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even though mission control had no idea where we were or whether we had survived, our families were informed that we had landed safely and were resting in a secluded dacha before returning to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like an extraordinary event to leave out (and if the gun had been fired, this would have been in a report), so it is most likely they just took comfort in the fact that they had a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to some questions about radio -- the craft was equipped with a radio beacon, and though Moscow did not receive the signal others did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had no idea if our rescue signal had been received. It turned out later that Moscow had not received it, but it had been picked up by listening posts as far away as Bonn, Germany. More importantly, a cargo plane flying close to our landing site had also picked it up. A search party had been dispatched, and late in the afternoon, we picked up the sound of a helicopter approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By December 21, 1968 when Apollo 8 was launched and nearly 4 days later as the events described in your questions took place, we only had one and over three years old account of encounter of Santa Claus from outer space. Gemini 6 astronauts Wally Schirra and Thomas Stafford, while orbiting the Earth, saw &lt;em&gt;an object that looked like a satellite going from North to South probably in a polar orbit, on a very low trajectory...&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was but one encounter and you know science, it demands repeatability. With the second observation by Lovell good three years later, we finally got a confirmation that Santa Clause and his reindeer exist and that they're on a once per year periodic trajectory with closest approach to Earth just before Christmas each year.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;There have been a few attempts to transmit messages to the stars with the assumption that there may be extraterrestrial civilizations somewhere out there to receive them. These messages (such as the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Arecibo message&lt;/a&gt;) were constructed based on certain assumptions about the way a message could be structured so that it could be decoded and understood by intelligent beings on a technological par with us. The Arecibo message, for example, has been subsequently deemed flawed due to the inability of test subjects to decipher it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Carl Sagan's novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(novel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; (and its movie adaptation), there is a depiction of a message received from space, the structure of the message, and the effort to interpret it. It highlights some of the challenges of both constructing and interpreting a message where neither sender nor recipient knows anything about the other's language, culture, or level of science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: if you are going to send a &quot;message in a bottle&quot; to the stars as a radio transmission, and you just want it to be the equivalent of &quot;hello, we're here and we want to be friends and get to know you&quot;, how do you design and encode such a message so that a recipient on a technological par with us has a good chance at understanding it? What technical choices do you make? How do you construct it so that it can say something meaningful without requiring the understanding of any human language? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems I need to add some further clarification to my question. I am not asking about choice of medium or spectrum (radio vs light, gamma pulse, whatever) but instead, given a suitable medium with which we can transmit a signal within which we have placed a constructed message, how do we arrange the information in that message so that a civilization with no prior knowledge of human language or culture could correctly interpret it? Further assuming it will be a stream of bits, how do we encode our message into bits? Given that the recipient has received our bit stream from their receiving apparatus, what steps would they have to perform to recover the intended meaning from that bit stream?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="14695" AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask this at aviation SE because they are quite rules-and-regulations oriented there, but this question is not (really) about aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to understand the &lt;em&gt;current situation&lt;/em&gt; for obtaining, and using GPS receivers that continue to work at very high altitude, or high speed, or both. Due to the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoCom#Legacy&quot;&gt;CoCom reguations&lt;/a&gt; I believe all GPS module manufacturers added limits to their products - probably in firmware - so that they would stop working if some combination of two limits had been reached. The limits are (I believe) &lt;code&gt;altitude &amp;gt; 18km&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;speed &amp;gt; 1000 knots&lt;/code&gt; (about 0.5 kilometer per second). &lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt;, although I am not sure, that these were implemented across the board by all manufacturers to avoid any possibility of sanctions or falllout similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoCom#Violations&quot;&gt;CNC machines sold and potential use for quiet sub propellors and subsequent sanctions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One subtlety is the question if the two limits (altitude, speed) are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jgc.org/2010/11/gaga-1-cocom-limit-for-gps.html&quot;&gt;applied in an OR or AND configuration&lt;/a&gt;, which matters if your application is balloon borne or even testing cubesat subsystems via balloon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/09/bypassin-us-gps-limits-for-active-guided-rockets/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; is intriguing, but it doesn't actually tell what the &quot;more relaxed rules&quot; are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Due to more relaxed rules, we now have the possibility to use GPS signals at higher altitudes and speeds. The problem is people normally don’t know how to either construct their own receivers or disable/modify the limits inside ready available modules (until now).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can find references to changing/updating/hacking the firmware to remove limits &lt;a href=&quot;https://saraspangelo.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rax_gps_design_combined.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://copenhagensuborbitals.com/gps-without-limits/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as a product &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cubesatkit.com/docs/datasheet/DS_CSK_GPSRM_1_710-00908-C.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Question is:&lt;/strong&gt; What exactly &lt;em&gt;are the rules now&lt;/em&gt;? Is it &quot;&lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;&quot; to change firmware or otherwise remove limits on ones own module? Can manufacturers of GPS modules ship them without the limits in certain cases?  What are the conditions? &lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; are the rules written so we can read them?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There is a standard clause included in all GPS receiver manuals regarding COCOM Limits. I cannot find the source of this clause, but since it is worded exactly the same in all the manuals I could find, I assumed it was probably derived directly from the regulation at some point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;COCOM Limits&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce requires that all exportable GPS
  products contain performance limitations so that they cannot be used
  in a manner that could threaten the security of the United States. The
  following limitations are implemented on the [named] receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Immediate access to satellite measurements and navigation results is
  disabled when the receiver’s velocity is computed to be greater than
  1000 knots, &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; its altitude is computed to be above 18,000 meters. The
  receiver continuously resets until the COCOM situation is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem based on this wording that the actual rule was OR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this rule appears to no longer be enforced. I am not a lawyer, but it appears that the current rule for those states which accept the Missile Technology Control Regime's controls in its Technical Annex is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;11.A.3. Receiving equipment for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS; e.g. GPS, GLONASS or Galileo), having any of the following characteristics, and specially designed components therefor:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a. Designed or modified for use in systems specified in 1.A.; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b. Designed or modified for airborne applications and having any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capable of providing navigation information at speeds in excess of 600 m/s;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your GPS reciever is capable of providing navigation information at speeds greater than 600 m/s, then you must have a special license, it would seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to alter a GPS receiver to remove COCOM limits or purchase a special GPS receiver without COCOM limits, it would appear that this is acceptable, but there may be licensing that you have to apply for. &lt;em&gt;I highly recommend consulting a lawyer before using such a GPS receiver in a COCOM situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="15046" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get a growth rate for commercial space flight, as it may be amenable to something like Moore's law. Wheras government funded things are prone to politics so can't really be rellied upon. Having such a number will make it possible to have more realistic timelines for things like colonizing moon/mars, mining asteroids etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a previous post about general statistics for space launches, which included both government and commercial launches:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/8566/what-is-the-success-failure-ratio-of-space-bound-rockets&quot;&gt;What is the success/failure ratio of space bound rockets?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious from the chart that the &quot;space wars&quot; drama from the 60's to 80's artificially inflated the amount of orbital launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other metric I was able to get is &quot;space vehicle and missle manufacturing&quot; which is also heavily interlaced with government funded military operations: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=843&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=843&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm wondering if anyone knows or can come up with statistics for just the commercial space industry,  unmanned such as satellites has been ongoing for a while.  Though manned (commercial) space flight is relatively recent, I think the first was when someone paid multiple millions of dollars to visit the ISS, and more recently the Virgin Galactic. 
SpaceX while a great innovator, many of their launches are still government contracts, so not all of their launches can be attributed to purely commercial purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the first &quot;commercial&quot; or non-government funded space-probe is light-sail ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://sail.planetary.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://sail.planetary.org&lt;/a&gt; ), which has yet to launch. The closest other thing I know to a &quot;space-probe&quot; is space burial, Celestis offers sending cremated remains to the moon and deep space. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;Another run of kerbal got me thinking about what, in reality, makes up the limit for small, but still useful space probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale should be obvious: The rocket equation does not hurt that much when we can make our payloads smaller and smaller. Assume a 10kg dry mass. With 260s ISP you get close to 6km/s delta-v out of a 100kg probe, enough to bring you into Mars orbit (and thus probably also somewhere in the belt). On a Falcon 9 you can start 220 of such probes at once, bringing launch cost down to about 300 000$. Probe production would also benefit from economics of scale. Finally, a certain risk of loss is not big deal anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the obvious question is: Are such probes useful? Or rather: What is the reason we do not launch such Microprobes today? Is it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The engine (is the smallest possible liquid fuel engine much bigger)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power supply (solar panels, batteries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientific instruments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is driving the payload weight currently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; David's answer below focused on optics and communication. So I try to be a little bit more precise: 
A large CMOS chip is roughly 16cm². Does one need that much more for in-orbit photography (because there is so little light)? According communication: Is antenna size really the issue (not wattage)? If so, why shouldn't you fold it?
Say we put a conventional, lightweight camera, top notch solar cells, a small battery, a raspi and a conventional GSM like sender on a probe and send it to a Phobos polar orbit. This &quot;science package&quot; should weigh under 1kg. That gives us another 9kg for attitude control, shielding etc. what am I missing?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Aside from optics and communications, there are other limitations to miniaturization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, smaller objects become harder to track if communication is lost. Our current orbital debris tracking system only tracks objects down to about the size of a marble, and with greater numbers of small items it becomes harder to avoid collisions with larger objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic components also suffer from reliability issues from radiation. Scaling down many components results in higher component density, and thus higher error rates as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;amp;arnumber=1545891&amp;amp;tag=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1545891%26tag%3D1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Radiation-induced soft errors in advanced semiconductor technologies - Baumann, R.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intechopen.com/books/numerical-simulation-from-theory-to-industry/soft-error-rate-of-advanced-sram-memories-modeling-and-monte-carlo-simulation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Soft-Error Rate of Advanced SRAM Memories: Modeling and Monte Carlo Simulation - Autran, et al.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Miniature components are more affected by this radiation and that can produce unexpected consequences: Computer resets, memory corruption, noise on instrumentation readouts (especially for imaging satellites). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down-scaling amplifies these consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With the constant downscaling of microelectronic devices, the sensitivity of integrated circuits to natural radiation coming from the space or present in the terrestrial environment has been found to seriously increase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me only remind you of the recent near-tragedy of Apollo 13. When the time of the crucial reentry of the astronauts approached, the Soviet Union discontinued all Russian radio transmissions in the frequency bands used by the Apollo Project in order to avoid any possible interference, and Russian ships stationed themselves in the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans in case an emergency rescue would become necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other sources for that claim?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/pg13.htm&quot;&gt;NASA's Space Educator's Handbook&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the men in Apollo 13 experienced what no men had undergone before, millions followed the developing drama by radio and television in public squares, private homes, schools, offices and factories. Pope Paul, at an audience in St. Peter's Basilica for 10,000 Romans and tourists, said &quot;We cannot forget at this moment the lot of the astronauts of Apollo 13. We hope that at least their lives can be saved.&quot; Prolonged applause followed. Prayers were said at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall and on the floor of Chicago's Board of Trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, April 14, the U.S. Senate adopted a resolution which urged all businesses and communications media to pause at 9 p.m., their local time, to &quot;permit persons to join in prayer for the safety of the astronauts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Offers of assistance with ships to aid in the recovery came from many nations. The Associated Press quoted the Russian news agency Tass as saying that four Soviet ships were steaming toward the splashdown area, one of them the Chumikan, a missile tracker equipped with a helicopter. Tass said the Chumikan and fishing trawler No. 8452 were ordered to join the cargo carriers Academician Rykachev and Novopolotsk converging on the Pacific target area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin sent a message saying: &quot;I want to inform you (U.S. Government) the Soviet Government has given orders to all citizens and members of the armed forces to use all necessary means to render assistance in the rescue of the American (Apollo 13) astronauts.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the radio transmissions? A contemporary &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;amp;dat=19700417&amp;amp;id=pR8rAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=CqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=5270,4050234&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;newspaper article in the Pennsylvania &lt;em&gt;Reading Eagle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Soviet government ordered all Soviet radio transmitters using frequencies close to those of Apollo 13 to maintain silence from the spacecraft's entry into the earth's atmosphere to its splashdown in the Pacific today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An official announcement said the precaution was being taken in response to the &quot;request of the U.S.A. administration and bearing in mind the exceptional importance of safeguarding stable, continuous radio communications with the Apollo 13 spacecraft.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The government also said a whaling expedition of several Soviet ships in the Pacific had been alerted to aid in the recovery of the astronauts if needed. The Soviets announced earlier that four other ships were heading for the splashdown target area to render any assistance needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There is a lot that the two missions you mentioned--&lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/em&gt;--have taught us about sample return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample Contamination: Serious measures were taken with &lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;/em&gt; to control for the possibility of sample contamination, but notable problems were still encountered:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, despite these precautions the
  Stardust spacecraft outgassing was sufficient to degrade
  camera operations, and the aerogel capture media
  was significantly contaminated during manufacture.
  We also never completely solved the problem of
  defining useful limits for organic contaminants of
  spacecraft hardware, which haunts us as we rather unexpectedly
  captured primitive cometary organics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landing Conditions and Sample Recovery: The landing site for &lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;/em&gt; in the Utah Test and Training Range was unexpectedly wet and the lack of a canister seal for the samples became an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample Curation: The necessary preparations for managing the returned sample take a long time--longer than expected:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More than two full years
  were required to prepare curation facilities for Stardust.
  Despite this seemingly adequate lead time, major
  changes to curation procedures were required once the
  actual state of the returned samples became apparent.
  Two years of Curation preparation are insufficient.
  The Stardust sample database was not fully implemented
  before sample return –we did not adequately
  think through all of the possible sub-sampling and
  analytical activities before settling on a database design.
  Remote storage of a sample subset is critical, for
  Stardust the remote samples are in a vault in New
  Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown Surface Conditions: &lt;em&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/em&gt; had to be designed without knowing what the surface of its target was like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We didn't know what Itokawa's surface would be like before the spacecraft actually arrived there. Indeed, the assignment given to us was quite broad. We were to build a device that, no matter what the surface was like, would grab samples, ranging from monolithic bedrocks to powdery regolith, in the brief instant of each of the spacecrfat's [sic] touchdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touchdown Time: &lt;em&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/em&gt; had to ascend immediately after touchdown, forcing the retrieval to occur quickly:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the sampler horn is attached to the edge of the spacecraft, if the horn were to contact the surface of the asteroid for too long, the spacecraft would start tumbling on its center of mass. In other words, if the spacecraft did not ascend right after the touchdown, it would lose its balance and fall on its rear. Thus samples would have to be collected in less than one second, by firing a bullet at a speed of 300 meters per second.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Juno produces five pole-to-pole latitudinal maps of microwave opacity as a function of
  altitude to depths greater than 100 bars (Figure 2). The independent swaths at different
  longitudes provide the ability to understand large scale features such as the Great Red
  Spot. The 0.1% precision of the radiometer allows us to measure small variations in radiance
  with respect to horizontal position and emission angle. With these measurements,
  we determine the global O/H and N/H ratios; we correlate the patterns of ammonia and
  water abundance below the clouds with the principal dynamical features at cloud-top
  level; we examine the deep roots of features like the Great Red Spot, the belts and zones,
  and potentially the 5- ?m hot spots. Context for these features is provided through &lt;strong&gt;coordinated
  Earth-based images&lt;/strong&gt; and comparison with data from the E/PO imager, JunoCam.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope did an ultraviolet emission study of vapor plumes from Europa's southern hemisphere in 2012. It found that the emissions were consistent with $H_2O$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;H2O freezes (19), and any enhancement must be localized to its source. In addition, electron impact on H2O (e + H2O) yields HI 121.6 nm and OI 130.4 nm, but has a lower cross section at 135.6 nm (20). Hence, the emission surplus at HI 121.6 nm and OI 130.4 nm in an area, where no remarkable enhancement of OI 135.6 nm is found, suggests a local atmospheric H2O enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The video below of the trajectory, released in July 2011 just before it launched, only states it will arrive at Jupiter in July 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How were the small adjustments made so that the craft would arrive in such a timely fashion? Was it due to the juggling always involved in launch dates, or was more involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: There are a range of possible launch dates and possible trajectories on missions, there is margin built in to missions, and a number of precedents for things being done for public relations reasons. July 4th is nearing and this question will occur to others, and at the moment there is no answer out there. If the answer is it is entirely coincidence, it seems that should be possible to demonstrate, and it would be especially nice to have a sense of how much play there is in launch dates, and how much fuel would be involved in making a minor adjustment in deep space to change arrival time by a day or two, and how much that might affect a mission of this kind (a polar orbit of Jupiter). Or some reference point for the decision process. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;On good authority (Warren Robinson of Lockheed Martin Space Systems, speaking unofficially and not on behalf of Lockheed Martin):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, the July 4th Jupiter arrival was a deliberate choice of the Principal Investigator and Customer team, made way back in the early days of the program.  Given the nature of orbital mechanics, the navigation could have fine tuned the date multiple times to be something different, but have done an excellent job keeping it precisely on the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NASA has a great love for having spacecraft events on July 4th, including Deep Impact hitting comet Tempel-1 on July 4th 2005, and even the Viking 1 Lander was originally scheduled to land on the Bi-centennial (July 4th 1776), though it end up delay as the program concluded the original landing location was too dangerous and a more suitable site was required.  It ultimately touched down on July 20th of that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The plan with multiple gravity assists to arrive at Jupiter on July 4th was actively maintained by the navigation team.  I would have to go back and play with some numbers, but I suspect it was not the most efficient trajectory, but honestly the difference is down in the noise (mere grams of propellant).  So yes, the trajectory correction burns in deep space were adjusted to maintain this timing.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Same was true for the Deep Impact mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the Viking missions to Mars, the conop was different in that an orbiter/lander carrier was inserted into Mars orbit the month before and the July 4th planned landing date wasn't dependent on in-flight trajectory maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="17160" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;As recent research has been started by a team around Stephen Hawking under the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3&quot;&gt;Breakthrough Starshot&lt;/a&gt; they are going for accelerating little probes up to 0.2~0.25$c$. There isn't that much information about it available yet, but they say there will be different obstacles before they really can start launching the probes. While I read it as its questionable the accelaration method will even work as expected, it seems no one else is having any doubt about it. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How they want to make probes the size of 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; be traveling for 30 years through space, while not hitting any particles at said 0.25$c$ or other stuff from that region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no one (or at least I was not able to find) was stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They will never ever be able to accelerate the probes to that speed because of [$reason]&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Given that the interstellar medium (ISM) has a density of about 1 atom per cubic centimeter and given that &lt;a href=&quot;http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6156&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;laser propulsion&lt;/a&gt; could, in theory, accelerate a spacecraft to 30% of the speed of light in ten minutes, I'm going to say this one is plausible. They are talking about using several probes, so even if a few happened to get destroyed by particles, some should remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we are talking about technology that will be available within the next couple of decades. They are not talking about launching today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Challenges/3&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a list of the challenges that the team has identified that they have to overcome. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/index.php?controller=Forum&amp;amp;action=viewforum&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;page=2&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; is in fact that protection is needed for the spacecraft from collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to understate the challenge of collision protection. One commenter (David Theil) on the Breakthrough Initiatives page says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At a typical interstellar medium density of 1 atom per cubic cm these can be ignored from a momentum consideration. Dust particles of order 10^-14 g in mass have density of roughly 10^-12 per cubic cm in the local bubble. A cm sized spacecraft could expect to encounter a few million of these beasties on the way to Alpha Cen (roughly 1 parsec.) At a speed of 6x10^9 cm/s (0.2c) each one will deposit about 10^5 ergs into our little spacecraft...not enough to raise the temperature all that much if averaged over the whole 1 gram mass (assumed heat capacity of silicon), BUT presumably enough to sputter away some protective coating. I would want to do some lab experiments to see how different coatings respond to such collisions. Even the LHC can't produce 10^16 eV particles. This is going to be a tough thing to test and will have to rely on modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Of these, the only one that isn't well known is Nitrogen. The Nitrogen levels at Mars are somewhat unknown, but expected to be pretty low overall. Of course, Nitrogen isn't required for a colony of what you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that actually takes area is to grow food, which you did not include. On Earth, growing crops requires about 1 acre of land per person per year. I believe Mars habitats would be closely monitored in temperature, and have less meat, which would increase the yield by a factor of two. More intense methods could make that to a single acre, as is discussed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/9582/244&quot;&gt;World Building&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it could be much less than this, but... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Martian, assuming a 2500 calorie diet of pure potatoes requires about 370 m^2 of land. Let's increase that to 500 m^2 to allow for other types of crops to be grown to give at least some variety. That also gives about 1 acre of land (4046 m^2) feeding 7 people So far so good, 4000 m^2 of farmland would be the minimal required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, the shelter could in theory be below the farmland and be just fine. Give, say, 500 m^2 for stuff on the surface, and one would be more than fine. Let's even round up, and say that about 700 m^2 of land is required per astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel for the return would come from the atmosphere. The amount of regolith required to make the water would vary depending on where you land, but might require some significant investment. If you are planning on purely solar powered operations, an area of 6600 m^2 of panels would be required to give 100 kWe of power. Nuclear is highly recommended, not only because it is more dense power wise, but also produces waste heat, which can be used for heating the habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of the player coming across an ancient spaceship, it being all spooky, rusted, battered, stained and generally knackered and creepy looking, but that doesn't seem realistic...I can't imagine rust happening, any stainy liquids that leaked out would just boil away etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if everyone abandoned a giant space station, turned the power off and just let it drift through space for evermore - would it look any different in 100/1000/100,000+ years? What about if it was in (stable) orbit above a planet, or near a star?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Spooky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is subjective. To some, just finding an abandoned spaceship would be spooky. I'll say there's probably not a lot that has to happen to evoke this feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rusted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, unless your spaceship never had a breathable atmosphere or the atmosphere was vented before the spaceship was abandoned, rust is totally possible on the inside and even the outside. As the oxygen escaped, rust would be produced on any exterior iron in contact with the venting oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/4154/would-unpainted-iron-or-steel-rust-in-space&quot;&gt;If you're in orbit of a planet with an oxygen atmosphere, the trace amounts could also cause some amount of rust over time.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of [apparent] oxidation on the Quest Joint Airlock thermal cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0eWz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0eWz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oxidation on the Quest Joint Airlock thermal cover&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tristan pointed out in the comments, the coloration is not actually oxidation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the discoloration on the airlock hatch cover is most likely not oxidation but rather contamination due to outgassing from materials that become volatile in the space environment (plastic, rubber, trace organic compounds in the interior atmosphere that get released when the hatch is opened, etc.). The brown color is from the contaminants being altered by UV radiation. To the extent that oxidation is occurring, it would act to bleach the discoloration, rather than contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, you can still see both that oxidation occurs, and that even if it wouldn't look like you imagine, there are other effects that can cause a similar appearance to rust on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from actual rust, when the coating and lubrication breaks down on metal parts, they will &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_welding&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;cold weld&lt;/a&gt; together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/10679/how-would-steel-degrade-in-space&quot;&gt;Steel will develop crystallographic defects and a positive charge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Battered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, this depends somewhat on where in space you are, but we're talking about an ancient spaceship. By that point, it's almost certain that its going to be battered by cosmic dust. Here's an example of what debris damage might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkh3Im.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkh3Im.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Debris damage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stained&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of parts will become discolored overtime by radiation exposure. Does that count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be hard to visualize this on other parts, but here's an example of UV effects on rope (the rope on the right is new, the left is affected by UV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CaF8h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CaF8h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;UV degradation on rope&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your spaceship is in orbit of a planet, you'll probably have even more junk to run into. I just hope you don't expect the thing to be operable. For that matter, if your spaceship is in too low of an orbit, then its orbit could decay and it could break apart rather quickly due to interaction with the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn't ask, but the spaceship might also get moldy, see this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/20334/melanized-fungi-on-the-iss-are-they-enjoying-the-elevated-radiation-levels-t&quot;&gt;Melanized fungi on the ISS - are they &amp;#39;enjoying&amp;#39; the elevated radiation levels there?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the fungi would require at least minimal levels of oxygen, so I wouldn't expect the mold to last long on an abandoned ship.&lt;/p&gt;

I asked whether exercise counted as work time, and Organic Marble suggested I ask this as a new question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we've had a question on how ISS crew splits their time between different activities before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't seem to address whether the allotted exercise time comes out of their 40 hour work week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is exercise part of their work hours or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update from comments:&lt;/strong&gt; A thorough answer to this question needs to address not only whether the exercise is counted in the work week, but how many hours are in the work week and what portion of it is exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;No, exercise time is not part of the &quot;40 hour&quot; work week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the question you linked to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;06.00 wake up, breakfast&lt;br&gt;
07.30 planning conference&lt;br&gt;
08.15 start of the work day: science and maintenance activities plus workouts.&lt;br&gt;
13.00 lunch&lt;br&gt;
14.00 resume work&lt;br&gt;
18.15 work preparation for the next day, another planning conference&lt;br&gt;
19.30 dinner, then free time&lt;br&gt;
21.30 sleep &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So work from 7.30 to 13.00 is 5.5 h, 14.00 to 19.30 is another 5.5 h, for a total of 11 h including 2.5 h of exercise and 1.5 h for planning conferences and preparation.
This leaves 7 h for science and maintenance activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That schedule is adhered to for 5 days/wk. On Saturday, astronauts do housekeeping and station maintenance. I'd count that as work as well. Sunday is a day off, unless there's an event (spacecraft arrives or leaves). Some science experiments have daily requirements so these continue though the weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NACRS_ISSResourceOverview_022014T.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ISS research resource planning&lt;/a&gt; shows that recent ISS expeditions had an average output of 40 hours/week of science when 6 crew were on board. 
That's 40 hours for 6 people combined. So most of their work day is spent on station operations and maintenance rather than science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 7th crewmember would be able to work mostly on science (as the maintenance workload doesn't increase much with 7 crew vs. 6). If he can spend all of his working hours Mon-Fri on science, that would add 35 h of science to the total output. Maybe a few hours on Saturday can be spent on science as well.   &lt;/p&gt;

Due to the fact that there will be no propellant system to perform orbit adjustment, and therefore the satellite will be injected to its final orbit directly. The satellite will also be designed to be compatible with other international piggyback launch opportunities, as the development of TSLV has been suspended.&lt;/p&gt;

The famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; was captured at the same time and is superimposed here as well as a narrow angle view of Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This color image of the sun, Earth and Venus was taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft Feb. 14, 1990, when it was approximately 32 degrees above the plane of the ecliptic and at a slant-range distance of approximately 4 billion miles. It is the first -- and may be the only -- time that we will ever see our solar system from such a vantage point. The image is a portion of a wide-angle image containing the sun and the region of space where the Earth and Venus were at the time with two narrow-angle pictures centered on each planet. The wide-angle was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band), and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large in the sky as seen from Voyager's perspective at the edge of the solar system but is still eight million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The image of the sun you see is far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The result of the brightness is a bright burned out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. The &quot;rays&quot; around the sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide angle lens. The two narrow-angle frames containing the images of the Earth and Venus have been digitally mosaiced into the wide-angle image at the appropriate scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear to me what this means. Maybe I don't understand the lingo, or maybe they are dumbing it down for the public. How is the entangled signal relayed by this satellite from China to Europe? Are the &quot;quantum key communicator&quot;, &quot;entanglement emitter&quot;, and &quot;laser communicator&quot; really separate devices? &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;JPL wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/space.2015.0018&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;A Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to Mars&quot;&lt;/a&gt; last year, which plots out a likely path given the current technology and budget situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture is a Phobos-first roadmap that has a 2.5 year round-trip to Phobos launching in 2033, with a 300-day stay at Phobos. After the Phobos trip, there would be a short-surface-stay mission to Mars, described as similar to Apollo 17, in 2039. This still doesn't sound quite like what you're asking about, since you're asking about a station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that, you have to look at the final mission in the architecture, the long-surface-stay Mars mission. The mission would be for a crew of four, and would start around 2040. Like the Phobos mission, there would be about 300 days on the surface starting in 2043. The mission would require 10 SLS launches. Here is an image depicting the stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BxpI8.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BxpI8.png&quot; alt=&quot;JPL Long Duration Mars mission plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each lander would be delivered in a manner almost identical
  to the crewed lander, with the exception that they could
  use direct entry and avoid aerocapture as an intermediate step.
  The crewed segments of the mission would be identical to the
  previous short-surface-stay mission, except that the full crew
  would go to the surface. This launch campaign would be implemented
  with a steady cadence of one SLS launch every 6
  months. The exception is that once every 2 years, two SLS
  launches would need to occur within one month of each other.
  Additional ground infrastructure at the Kennedy Space Center
  would be required to support those biennial extra launches, and
  that capability would be needed by about 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the SLS and the Orion, which are still in development, the mission would also need at least four additional vehicle types that are either planned or still under study: the planned Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tug; and the Deep Space Habitat (DSH), In-Space Chemical Propulsion stage, and Mars Lander/Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) which are still under study. These are listed for the short duration mission, but are also present on the long duration mission. They do not go into the specifics of the needs for the long duration mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also details plans to progress toward a permanent outpost. It says &quot;using this example architecture, a new crew of four could be sent to
Mars every 4 years along with two cargo landers.&quot; These missions would continue to extend the base on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition to consumables, the cargo landers could
  bring exploration equipment such as pressurized rovers, advanced
  surface power systems, science equipment, drilling
  equipment, in situ resource utilization (ISRU) packages, and
  additional habitation volume. As the Mars base expands, some
  crew would stay for the minimum cycle time of about 350
  days, but others could possibly stay for a much longer time
  and wait for the next Earth return opportunity. In this way, the
  base could eventually be permanently occupied and evolve
  toward increasing self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the readiness level of the described technologies, they estimate that this concept should be affordable given the sunset of the ISS in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Annual budget constraints need to be considered as a design
  requirement for human journey to Mars architectures
  since it is likely that the NASA budget will not see a dramatic
  increase beyond adjustments for inflation. This in turn requires
  a phased approach toward establishing a permanent
  outpost on Mars to allow the technical risk and the required
  funding to be spread out and still deliver significant and publicly engaging milestones along the way. One such approach
  is presented here as an example. It is a minimal architecture
  that relies on assets already under development or
  planned by NASA. A series of missions in cislunar space
  would lead to a Phobos lander in 2033 to be followed in short
  order by a dress rehearsal landing on the Moon, and then by a
  crew to the surface of the red planet by 2039.
  We hope that the ideas and principles introduced here in
  whole or in part can be a useful input to the process of structuring
  an implementable human journey to Mars in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasize that at this stage, this is just one example architecture, though the paper notes that other studies have used portions of this as a basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The Hydro Impact Basin (HIB) holds about 3.4 million liters of water.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Just speculating here, but Osiris in an Egyptian myth &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=C1zI3P2jq8QC&amp;amp;pg=PA167&amp;amp;lpg=PA167&amp;amp;dq=osiris+ladder+to+heaven&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=3RW86kypOZ&amp;amp;sig=YayaO9PhhMcIIX9EkApOiHCGhiU&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi86o_mtZbZAhUDL6wKHef0BnEQ6AEISTAJ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=osiris%20ladder%20to%20heaven&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ascended a ladder into the heavens&lt;/a&gt;.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Sexual psychology in space could in fact be an issue, as you have surmised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=1U72hLZzZEQC&amp;amp;lpg=PR14&amp;amp;ots=vRFJTzAHe0&amp;amp;dq=Nick%20Kanas%20Human%20Interactions%20in%20Space&amp;amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=gender&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Space Psychology and Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Kanas and Dietrich Manzey, there is a section on gender issues which states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rosnet and colleagues [2004] found the presence of seduction behavior, rivalry, and sexual harassment in their polar station when the women were about the same age as the men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The possibility of pairing and sexual contact also needs to be considered during long-duration space missions. Will such activities lead to jealousies and problems in crew cohesion? In a recent space simulation project conducted in Moscow that involved several multinational teams of isolated and confined individuals (called SFINCSS, or Simulation of a Flight of International Crew on Space Station), a female participant reported unwanted sexual advances (including kissing) from a male participant. This resulted in a breakdown of cohesion and group rancor that affected not only the isolated teams but also the participating agencies [Inoue et al., 2004; Kass and Kass, 2001; Sandal, 2004]. Stuster [1996] has pointed out that similar unwanted sexual attention has occurred during Antarctic missions, and that disruptions in cohesion have taken place as a result of male-female pairings. He also stated that if a woman chooses to have a relationship during her stay in the Antarctic, it often is with one man, with a preference for senior over junior personnel. Although the other men usually accept the situation, disruptions may occur if the relationship involves the station leader, who is seen as having an unfair advantage. Along these lines, it is interesting that in the days of the polar explorers, the commanding officer of the ship or the expedition leader was permitted the luxury of taking his wife or mistress with him on the long voyage [Stuster, 1996]. Buckey [2006] has reviewed a number of sexual and non-sexual tensions that might occur in a mixed-gender crew going to Mars. He suggests that the crew-members could be observed under isolated and confined conditions during training to see how they come together as a team in reference to possible problems with harassment, flirtatiousness, or jealousy. Should such problems occur, further training or even replacement of offending crewmembers might be necessary for the actual mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One might argue that future crews should consist of married couples or stable male-female pairs in order to minimize competition and conflict. However, there is no reason to expect that such a crew composition would prevent secret liaisons and jealousies, since infidelity and extra-marital relations occur on Earth in less stressful interpersonal environments. Enforced platonic relationships and sexual abstinence also is a possibility, but it is difficult to imagine this as a realistic scenario for healthy energetic people who are confined together for long periods of time. Perhaps novel social systems and customs will evolve in space that are similar to those found in communes, where pairing and unpairings will be tolerated with a minimum of conflict and animosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this it would seem that there is currently no existing policy (beyond whatever sexual harassment policy we can assume to be in place), but that this issue is one under heavy consideration, especially as the time of human interplanetary travel approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can be sure of is that this issue is under study, and that the astronauts are given counseling on top of their extensive training. The screening and training process probably minimizes the issues that are experienced, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/21oct_getalong/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it has been noted&lt;/a&gt; that even in these conditions suppressing such issues only postpones an inevitable reaction of some form. Instead, it would seem that healthy outlets need to be provided.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Recently we had the 15 year anniversary of Expedition 1 of the ISS. That particular crew launched in a Soyuz (TM-31) and returned on a Space Shuttle (Discovery, STS-102), which I found a remarkable aspect for a space mission!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which led me to wonder who else has returned to Earth in a different type of vehicle than the one in which they launched? After a little searching around I found that ISS Expedition 6 launched on a Space Shuttle (Endeavour, STS-113) and returned in a Soyuz (Soyuz TMA-1), but my quick superficial search didn't uncover anyone else. I thus tallied a total of six people from trips to the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other missions I found were Shuttle trips to Mir. For example it looks like STS-71 (Atlantis) picked up three Russian cosmonauts who had launched on Soyuz TM-21, and dropped off two at Mir to return on Soyuz TM-21. There are probably more, but I had no easy way of searching. So if anyone has an easy way to extract that information, maybe we can compile the full list? I've collected the ones I have found so far in a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We would expect that Voyager 1's local time is faster than Earth time by about one part in one hundred million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don't think that the Voyager oscillator is stable enough to measure that small of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect would be due to gravitational time dilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that &quot;all&quot; that is needed would appear to be a highly stable and accurate oscillator and counter, it seems a &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; simple thing to test that would not add a lot to the mass or power budgets of a spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have we ever launched any probe that included an experiment to prove or disprove gravitational time dilation?&lt;/strong&gt; If yes, then what were the results thus obtained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly if not, then &lt;strong&gt;are any such probes currently known to be in the idea or planning stages?&lt;/strong&gt; Also, what are the major obstacles in designing and launching such a probe?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes, time dilation was experimentally confirmed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gravity Probe A&lt;/a&gt;, launched by NASA on June 18, 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock rates of two masers (one on the probe and one on Earth) were compared, and it was found that the difference matched what was predicted with an accuracy of about 70 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address your question of challenges in designing the mission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To yield an accurate and inexpensive experiment, GP-A required a flight path with a large change in the gravitational potential to provide a large gravitational redshift, and it required a flight path that kept the flight Hydrogen MASER in contact with the ground Hydrogen MASER during data collection.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Here is an approximate answer for the Budget year of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005 1.8 Billion was spent on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$140 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Cargo/Crew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$350 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Operation Program Integrity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$25 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Medical support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$425 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Launch and Operations (Does Not include Shuttle Launch Costs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$70 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$650 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Craft Operations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$150 Million&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as Flight and Crew Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can safely say that with no crew on-board that the following categories can be excluded: Cargo/Crew, Medical Support and Flight and Crew Systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total cost of those categories adds up to 315 Million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are left with two categories that may or may not overlap with crew related activities. 
Launch and Operations, and Operation Program Integrity.
Which together compose of $775 Million of the total budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can add together the definite and probable cost sectors for the Human Aspect of the ISS which will land you somewhere between 315 Million and 1 Billion (17.5%-55%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End Result : Depending on how you look at it, the Human aspect of the 2005 Budget for the ISS will be within the range of 315 Million and 1 Billion (17.5%-55% of the total budget).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As geoffc pointed out in the comments, the Atlantic is a lot wider than the Gulf. Once the rocket has crossed the Gulf it will still be low enough that anything that falls over land could still cause damage. Once the rocket has crossed the Atlantic, it should already be high enough that this is not really much of an issue (stuff burns up in the atmosphere as it falls).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine there are a number of reasons why the cupola windows would generally be set to block the sun, so letting sunshine into the crew area may be limited or discouraged, but I'm wondering if astronauts sometimes feel like opening the shades and letting natural light in &lt;em&gt;at least once in a while&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Do ISS astronauts &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; let the sunshine in for a natural light &quot;fix&quot; - in other words to get a refreshing few minutes in natural lighting for a change? If so, are there limitations or restrictions associated with doing so?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="20799" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;This year Santa has decided to try a new strategy to deliver presents which he hopes will require less physics-defying magic, since magic is in short supply these days. Instead of personally flying gifts to every child in the world in one night, Santa would like to launch one or more rockets from the North Pole that enter into an orbit around the Earth and then drop presents over each country in the world. From there locally stationed elves will distribute the presents to each house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about the propulsion, weight, or distribution. Santa has those aspects covered. You can assume that the payload starts out at a miraculous 195 kg. A kilo is dropped for each country. If you require multiple rockets, the payload must be appropriately divided between them (1 kg per drop). You can drop anywhere over the country. You don't really have any time constraints. Santa wants all the drops done before the first country experiences midnight December 25, but that shouldn't be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing for both number of orbits and number of burns (Santa wants to minimize $orbits \times burns$), what is the minimum number of orbits required to perform all 195 drops, where an orbit is one revolution of one rocket around the Earth?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="864"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;To grossly oversimplify, astrobiologists generally consider three broad prerequisites for life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a liquid solvent (such as water)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chemical building blocks (such as organic molecules)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an energy source (such as sunlight, directly as in plants or indirectly as in animals who eat plants or eat other animals that eat plants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because water-based, carbon-based life fueled by stellar energy is what we know most about, this is generally what we look for. However, scientists do consider other configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though more exotic solvents (like ammonia, liquid nitrogen, or supercritical carbon dioxide) may exist in extrasolar systems, the only surface liquids outside of Earth that we know about today occur on Saturn’s smoggy moon Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titan's seas are made of liquid methane and ethane, which is considered as a possible alternative solvent for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we've never found life that uses a different solvent or building blocks (even on Earth), it is mostly hypothetical, and so we are limited in how much we can search for them. If we assumed that some sort of electromagnetic-based life existed, how would we go about looking for it? What are the signs that such life is present? We don't even know if such life is present on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

One passage in 'blacker the better' caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Melanized fungi actually seem to thrive in environments with high levels of ionizing radiation (ultraviolet, x and gamma rays), which is usually seen as very dangerous to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The walls of the damaged nuclear reactor of Chernobyl are covered in melanized fungi and they also are found living very happy on board of the International Space Station. Experiments showed that these melanized species of fungi seem to benefit from radiation, increasing their growth and germination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanized fungi seem to be fungi which can produce a form of melanin, which may be able to derive some biological advantage (energy for synthesis or metabolism perhaps) from light or even radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have melanized fungi been found happy on the ISS? Is there anything written about this I could read? Any idea if they are gaining some biological advantage from higher radiation levels there? Were they there intentionally (part of an experiment) or did did they travel as common contamination or spores from Earth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;fungi can grow inside the space station and could decompose food and other organic materials in humid conditions. After exposure to air growth stopped, fungal hairs (filaments) developed within the food source and decomposed it by producing digesting enzymes. Submerged filaments don’t make spores, but fungi could still spread through direct contact. Dry spores remained living after 5 months in microgravity, with some fungi living longer than others. The data show that spores would grow well on salted food in space, and some species grow on iron surfaces covered with small quantities of carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the species used by the experiment was &lt;em&gt;Ulocladium chartarum&lt;/em&gt;, which is a melanized fungi. You can see more on the results of the experiment at the link above. The experiment found that melanized fungi were indeed resistant to cosmic radiation to the degree that radiation was not found to affect their growth, instead microgravity was the main inhibitor. I did not see anything about radiation providing any &lt;em&gt;advantage&lt;/em&gt;, but it was at least not an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment page also includes a picture of an actual contamination (of what appears to be melanized fungi) on one of the interior panels of the ISS. The caption says that the crew has weekly sessions to clean such surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a quick dump of TLEs for Satcats &lt;code&gt;39451&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;39452&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;39453&lt;/code&gt;, and estimated their semimajor axes and then altitudes and got the plot below, to double check that SWARM hasn't dipped down to 300km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the reports mention that Steve's ion temperature is 3000C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/When_Swarm_met_Steve&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ESA News Release&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Prof. Donovan said, “&lt;strong&gt;As the satellite flew straight though Steve&lt;/strong&gt;, data from the electric field instrument showed very clear changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The temperature &lt;strong&gt;300 km above Earth’s surface&lt;/strong&gt; jumped by 3000°C and the data revealed a 25 km-wide ribbon of gas flowing westwards at about 6 km/s compared to a speed of about 10 m/s either side of the ribbon. (emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did one or more of the three SWARM spacecraft above 440km measure the plasma temperature of Steve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/21219/12102&quot;&gt;more about Steve in this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are are still learning more about Steve, but here are seven things we think we know so far:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve appears ~10-20° (in latitude) closer to the equator (south in the Northern hemisphere) than where the normal green aurora is overhead. This means it could be overhead at latitudes similar to Calgary, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve is a very narrow arc aligned East-West and extending for hundreds or thousands of miles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve emits light in mostly purple-ish colors. It is quite faint but is usually photographed with 5-10 second exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is accompanied by a rapidly evolving green short-lived picket fence structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve can last 20 min or even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve appears to have a season. For instance, it has not been observed by citizen scientists from October 2016 to February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomena has been reported from the UK, Canada, Alaska, northern US states, and even New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Editor's note: I'm maintaining here information from user &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/users/19483/roger&quot;&gt;Roger&lt;/a&gt; until he decides to migrate on his own.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer to the question: &quot;Can you add a link or citation that confirms that the temperature of Steve's ions was actually measured by the TII?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the presentation from Eric Donovan at the 4th Swarm science meeting in Banff: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esa.int/spaceinvideos/Videos/2017/03/Opening_of_Swarm_and_CryoSat_Science_Meetings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.esa.int/spaceinvideos/Videos/2017/03/Opening_of_Swarm_and_CryoSat_Science_Meetings&lt;/a&gt;
around the time 1:22:14 -&gt; after almost 25 seconds the actual Swarm data are shown (from top to bottom: ion velocity, magnetic anomaly, ion temperature and electron density).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer to the question &quot;how did the ESA probe measure Steve's temperature?&quot;: The ion temperature is measured by an Thermal Ion Imager (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://efi.phys.ucalgary.ca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://efi.phys.ucalgary.ca/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be an ORU with a Space-to-Ground Antenna (SGANT) spare. That has me wondering--how good of condition do these spares stay in, while mounted on the outside of the ISS, when they are not in use?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="169"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;In general, pretty good condition.  The ORUs are designed to live outside for their functional life (more less the same as station's), so there's generally no reason they can't live outside while they're waiting to be called upon.  Many of them have flight support equipment (FSE) that provides some support to keep them alive.  These are typically heaters, sometimes telemetry monitors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are evaluated for environmental risks just the same as the operational ORUs are -- most of them are better protected in their stored locations, by virtue of the location itself or by dedicated covers.  Both of these options generally serve to create a more benign environment for the ORU than it would experience in its deployed, operational state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all spare ORUs are stored outside.  Some are small enough (the Sequential Shunt Unit, for example) to be kept indoors and transition through the airlock with the crew.  There's a trade-off to be made, however.  Keeping an ORU outside presents the opportunity to be able to replace it purely robotically, if it was designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

It carried a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/21695/12102&quot;&gt;Prop-M rover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lander started transmitting from the surface but went silent about 14 seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did rover deployment absolutely require a ground command, or is there some possibility that it could have deployed automatically and &quot;roved&quot; a bit on the Martian surface? Is there anything that can conclusively rule this in or out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_2&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the rover was to remain attached by an umbilical to the lander, and do some local exploration while monitored and sometimes filmed by the lander.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/meet-the-very-first-rover-to-land-on-mars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;IEEE Spectrum article&lt;/a&gt; explains that PROP-M was never deployed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sadly, PROP-M never got a chance to do any exploring. The Mars-3 lander separated from its spacecraft on December 2, 1971, and entered the Martian atmosphere. After aerobraking with a heat shield, the lander deployed a parachute to slow itself down, and then when within range of the ground fired its retrorockets and made a successful landing on the surface, impacting the ground at about 20 meters per second and cushioning itself with shock-absorbing foam. Four petals on top of the capsule opened and the lander began to transmit data 90 seconds after landing, but all contact was lost just 20 seconds later, &lt;strong&gt;before the PROP-M rover had a chance to deploy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis added&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just read this portion, there might still be some uncertainty as to whether it could have deployed on its own, but the explanation of how the rover was intended to work clears that up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The way that PROP-M was intended to work was that after landing, &lt;strong&gt;a signal from Earth&lt;/strong&gt; would instruct the Mars-3 lander to place the rover on the surface with a robotic arm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis added&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, there can no longer be any uncertainty. The rover did not have an automatic deploy function. It was awaiting a signal from Earth, thus since communication was interrupted it could not have deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Public information on rabbits in space is surprisingly sparse. The earliest instance I have been able to find is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.space.com/20648-animals-in-space-history-infographic.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;July 2, 1959&lt;/a&gt; launch of the Soviet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronautix.com/r/r-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;R-2&lt;/a&gt;, which reportedly carried the first rabbit into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the question, a rabbit was also aboard &lt;a href=&quot;http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-first-animals-in-space-1399364861&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Korabl-Sputnik 2&lt;/a&gt;, which is more well-known for the dogs Belka and Strelka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find a 1999 Japanese study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11543026&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Development of the aortic baroreflex system under conditions of microgravity&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to science performed on rabbits in microgravity. Unfortunately, it is only the abstract, and I was unable to find which mission this was associated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching the NASA domain, I found &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; of lots of incidents of rabbits in space, but none with any detail. I did find one old document (which I've since lost) that mentioned that one of the cons of using rabbits for space experiments was their high susceptibility to stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found another Japanese paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990110/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Life science experiments performed in space in the ISS/Kibo facility and future research plans&lt;/a&gt;, containing proposals for experiments aboard the ISS through 2024. It has one brief mention of rabbits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mammals such as mice and small rabbits are to be grown and bred in space to analyze fertilization, growth, development, movement and living under µg and 1 g conditions. Centrifugation systems in the ISS will be used to provide different levels of gravity. Potential projects are studies of reproduction, development, birth, care of offspring, behavior and healthcare in gene knockout (mutated) and parental wild-type animals. Multichannel telemetry will be used to monitor body temperatures and behavior with a CCD camera and to download data to the Earth from the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speculated in the comments that if they keep sending rabbits up, one might expect them to have at least some survivability. On the other hand, perhaps people just really &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/2330/58&quot;&gt;want&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rabbits in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the comments, Chad pointed out that &quot;[a] living and stressed rabbit will generally not eat or eat very little and will not reproduce&quot; and a 1g centrifuge for rabbits would &quot;require [a lot] of equipment for a few animals on the ISS&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;We are used to having hundreds of megabits or more per second of data transfer rates at our fingertips, over the Internet, straight to our desks. For higher-end connections, even multiples of gigabits per second isn't at all uncommon. This makes transferring even large amounts of data basically trivial. Large storage media is also common, allowing us to store the data both prior to and after transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that's a pretty recent development. It wasn't more than some 30 years ago that a 10 megabit per second connection could be considered a fast local area network, and a few hundred kilobits per second was a respectable inter-network link. Only some 15 years ago, a hard disk on the order of 100 GB was on the large end of the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such an environment where what we might today consider high-speed data transfer simply wasn't a thing, &lt;strong&gt;how was radio telescope observation data transferred between science teams, and between locations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="21894" AnswerCount="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update March 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; I just saw this in Buzzfeed (Google sent me there, I don't normally read it): &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/ale-shooting-star-satellite-meteor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rich People Will Soon Be Able To Buy Fake Meteor Showers On Demand&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Then I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/21890/12102&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; and got quite a rise out of some people. Apparently releasing a lot of ~1cm objects into LEO set off some some &quot;internal alarms&quot; ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can someone describe what it is specifically that makes those actually more scary than the standard objects released (=discarded) these days into LEO?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There's a few pieces of information that are needed to explain why one might be wary of 1 cm objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Objects as small as 4 inches (about 10 cm) can be seen by radars or optical telescopes on Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops, can't see 'em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are also millions of pieces of debris smaller than a third of an inch (1 cm). In Low Earth-orbit, objects travel at 4 miles (7 kilometers) per second. At that speed, a tiny fleck of paint packs the same punch  of a 550 pound object traveling at 60 miles per hour. Not only can such an impact damage critical components such as pressurized items, solar cells, or tethers, they can also create new pieces of potentially threatening debris.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even a salt-sized grain hitting the space shuttle creates orbital debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch, it multiplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6p27.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6p27.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chip in ISS window&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The chip you see in the image above is 7mm in diameter and orbiting above us embedded in one of the International Space Station’s windows. It’s tiny, and definitely a chip not a crack, but in the vacuum of space you have to take even the smallest of impacts deadly seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Luckily, the windows used on the space station are made of some pretty sturdy stuff – borosilicate-glass, fused-silica, and are quadruple-glazed for extra protection.The chip was caused by space debris &lt;strong&gt;only a few thousandths of a millimeter across&lt;/strong&gt;. It could have just been a flake of paint or tiny piece of metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis added&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes, a little can do a lot of damage!&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="21929" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;The video in the interesting question &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/q/17089/12102&quot;&gt;How did the GoFast 2014 Rocket de-spin?&lt;/a&gt; shows a de-spin that went well. An initial very fast spin (for stabilization during propulsion) is almost perfectly de-spun during a maneuver that is so fast that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/17091/12102&quot;&gt;is hard to imagine it could be anything else&lt;/a&gt; but a Yo-Yo de-spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematics behind this is summarized &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/19437/12102&quot;&gt;in this answer&lt;/a&gt; along with links to several original sources. Briefly, $r$ is the ratio of final to initial angular velocity, and will be zero at perfect de-spin but can still be positive or negative for undershoot or overshoot conditions. The remaining terms are described in detail in &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/19437/12102&quot;&gt;the link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{m(d+a)^2}{I}=\frac{1-r}{1+r}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a balance. So if the final angular &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; is much much lower than the initial (near perfect cancellation), it suggests that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the initial spin rate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the de-spin were well controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of careful spin and de-spin cancellation (but not with a Yo-Yo) is discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/19437/12102&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/19440/12102&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt; about NASA's LSDS test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the initial spin had some uncertainty that could not be controlled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Has adjustable Yo-Yo de-spin been tested or demonstrated? Reading about a serious but untested proposal would also be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of all kinds of possible ways to do this, last-second laser trimming of the wires, or just a clever break-away release, vernier yo-yos (say 10kg plus 160g, 80g, 40g, 20g, 10g independently addressable &quot;fine yo-yos&quot;) but this kind of complexity really defeats the elegance and reliability of the Yo-Yo technique with fixed mass weights and premeasured wires, so maybe backup thrusters to re-adjust the spin before Yo-Yo would be a better way to stay with known technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, have variable Yo-Yo's been tested or demonstrated?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s the Goddard Space Flight Center devoted some study to the topic of  error in yo-yo de-spin. It was acknowledged that spin-up errors and uncertainty of the spin axis moment of inertia were sources of de-spin error. Since de-spin error can be a source of many problems, which may even impact the success of the mission, the stretch yo-yo concept was devised to reduce de-spin error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19630004528.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Analytical Theory of the Stretch Yo-Yo For De-Spin of Satellites&quot; by Joseph V. Fedor&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A device that greatly reduces spin-up errors and errors due to variations in spin moment of inertia is the stretch yo-yo (the stretch concept was first suggested by Henry Cornille of Goddard Space Flight Center (Reference 3). It can consist of a weight, a spring, a wire, and end fittings (Figure 1), or
  simply a weight, spring, and end fittings (Figure 2). The purpose of the spring is to compensate for errors in initial spin-up. For example, in a given stretch yo-yo application there will be a certain amount of stretching or elongation of the spring during normal operation. If the initial spin is greater than the nominal value, the spring will elongate more than normal during operation and reduce the spin to the desired value. If the initial spin is less than the nominal initial spin, the spring will elongate less
  than normal during functioning and correct for the under spin. The stretch yo-yo is a simple example of an adaptive control system: it senses the spin environment it is in and corrects accordingly. Also, it will be shown that the stretch yo-yo is relatively insensitive to variations (uncertainties) of the spin moment of inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analysis and design, it was decided that the stretch yo-yo despin should be tested on the Ariel I spacecraft, and in April 1962, it was successfully flown (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19630011465.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Analysis of the Dynamic Tests of the Stretch Yo-Yo De-Spin System&quot; by William R. Mentzer&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following dynamic analysis and development of design equations for the stretch yo-yo, the decision was made to fabricate and test stretch yo-yos on the Explorer XII (1961 v1) and Ariell (1962 01) type payloads. Three series of tests were conducted beginning with feasibility tests on the two payloads
  and concluding with flight qualification tests for the Ariel I payload. As a result of these tests, a stretch yo-yo was flown on the successful Ariel I spacecraft in April 1962.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the record of the experimental results, the effects of the several variables involved in stretch yo-yo design can be readily noted. These variables include optimum spring constant, preload, initial spin rate, spin moment of inertia, and material strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the full analysis of the tests in that document, but here's one last brief note on the effectiveness of the stretch yo-yo de-spin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Explorer XII type optimum spring scale tests clearly demonstrated the ability of the stretch yo-yo to compensate for errors in initial spin rate. In this series of tests, spin-up errors of +/-20 percent were reduced to within +/-1.5 percent of the design final spin rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The first transistors in space (and in orbit) were likely germanium, and they were aboard Sputnik-2 in 1957, though Sputnik-2 did use vacuum tubes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first all-transistor satellite was Explorer 1, as explained by George Ludwig:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the Explorer I the first earth satellite to carry transistor electronics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In my original interview I said that it was.  Since then, I researched the question and found that, although the Soviets did not use transistors in Sputnik I, Sputnik II, launched in November 1957, did use a few transistors in one of its instruments.  Of course they had a much larger launch capacity and could carry vacuum tubes and their required batteries.  The Explorer I launch occurred on January 31st local time, which was actually February l Greenwich time, of 1958.  It was the first all-transistor satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explorer 1 used a combination of germanium and silicon transistors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sputnik-2 and Explorer 1 were the second and third satellites to orbit Earth, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first computer in space (and first computer in orbit) was the Gemini digital computer, built by IBM, which first flew in 1965. It was IBM's first completely silicon semiconductor computer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="21967" AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/21961/12102&quot;&gt;The answer&lt;/a&gt; to my question &lt;em&gt;The first transistors in space: Germanium or Silicon? What about LEO?&lt;/em&gt; actually addressed both the first Germanium and Silicon transistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I've gotta ask about electron tubes (valves). It sounds like Sputnik-1 and Sputnik-2 had tubes, although 2 had a mix of both. But after that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are types of electron devices are used in RF amplifiers (e.g. klystrons, traveling wave tubes) and of course photomultiplier tubes are &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/21945/12102&quot;&gt;still being sent to space regularly&lt;/a&gt; (there - the ISS version is scheduled for 2020) and these could count as interesting answers, but what I'm primarily looking for is the small, compact devices like you'd find in an old radio, with the filament, grid(s) and plate all right next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance is that even then, transistors required so much less power than vacuum tubes because they didn't require heated cathodes (filaments) for thermionic emission of carriers. By doping a low band-gap semiconductor material, carriers could be generated at 0C rather than cherry-red hot. That meant that you could power a 1 watt transmitter with a few watts of electrical power, something sustainable with photovoltaics, and that was critical for making satellites long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if you want to go to Venus, you just choose a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/20096/12102&quot;&gt;higher band-gap semiconductor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I should really get back to finishing the other answer. In the mean time here is some recent (today's) news. I've skimmed the Science journal article now and added a summary here. Will improve it further tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;today's news:&lt;/strong&gt; The current news is about a demonstration of &lt;em&gt;producing entangled pairs in space&lt;/em&gt; and successfully receiving each member of the pair at a separate ground station. This is an important step, but this is not the same as, or close to relaying information from one ground station to another. So far they have confirmed that the photon pairs received at two ground stations are entangled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;below:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 4. Measurement of the received entangled photons after transmission by the two-downlink channel. (A)&lt;/strong&gt; Normalized two-photon coincidence counts in the measurement setting of the jHi=jVi basis. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt; Normalized counts in the diagonal jTi basis. Numbers in parentheses represent the raw coincidence counts of different measurement settings&quot; From Figure 4 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6343/1140&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yin et al. 2017, Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there were polarizers at each receiving station changing polarization states independently using different sequences at each site. When they happened to be in combinations where the entangled photons would both pass, the count rate was much higher than when they had combinations that would not pass &lt;em&gt;photons entangled in this particular way&lt;/em&gt;. In this case the polarizers at the ground stations were (likely synchronized) Pockels cells running different pseudo-random polarization sequences at 4 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDk3O.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDk3O.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the future&lt;/strong&gt;, they will try to use this to send an encryption key from one ground station to the other ground station. They would then use the key to transmit data in a conventional way over any high speed link. They could use the internet, dedicated fiber, or even use QUESS in a simpler photorepeater mode for a very small message. You'd use a different satellite with bigger telescopes for high bandwidth, this would be purely a demo. Of course you' really just use fiber on the ground or &quot;the normal internet&quot; once you have successfully sent your key with entangled photons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt; Use the think that Einstein didn't like; &quot;Spooky Action at a Distance&quot;. One ground station (the sender) manipulates it's received photons from space in one of various ways, causing the entangled photon received at the other ground station to suddenly attain the complementary state. In many Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) demonstration, the entangled pair generator and one receiving station are located physically much closer together and the only long link is between the pair generator and the other receiving station. Other demonstrations however will use similarly long paths for both photons in the pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the Q&amp;amp;A format in the LA Times particularly transparent and helpful. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QlcKuxDGrs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by Science is really worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUESS converts single photons of UV (visible) light from a 405nm photodiode laser (PL in the figure) into pairs of 810nm photons using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_titanyl_phosphate#Periodically_poled_potassium_titanyl_phosphate_.28PPKTP.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;parametrically poled KPT crystal&lt;/a&gt; (PPKPT in the figure). Similar KPT crystal material is also used in older style &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_pointer#Green&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;green laser pointers&lt;/a&gt; to convert pairs of 1064nm photons into single 532nm green photons. QUESS then uses its two telescope systems. They are not identical but one is schematically represented here. One of the two beams of entangled 810nm photons enters from the bottom. It is combined with &quot;helper beams&quot; of 850nm and 532nm (described below) There is also a camera sampling return signals from the Earth station at 671 nm through the same telescope (top left) and directly (bottom). During operation one of these systems is pointed to each of two independent ground stations, and each one tracks the motion of the ground station through several levels of feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;below:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 1. Schematic of the spaceborne entangled-photon source and its in-orbit performance. (A)&lt;/strong&gt; The thickness of the KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal is 15 mm. A pair of off-axis concave mirrors focus the pump laser (PL) in the center of the PPKTP crystal. At the output of the Sagnac interferometer, two dichromatic mirrors (DMs) and long-pass filters are used to separate the signal photons from the pump laser. Two additional electrically driven piezo steering mirrors (PIs), remotely controllable  on the ground, are used for fine adjustment of the beam-pointing for an optimal collection efficiency into the single-mode fibers.

For polarization compensation, two motorized QWPs and a HWP are remotely controlled. A fast steering mirror (FSM) and a two-axis turntable are used for closed-loop fine and coarse tracking, based on the 671-nm beacon laser images captured by cameras 1 and 2.

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that the definition of robot can be a bit of a slippery slope. Can a spacecraft which has autonomous docking capability be considered a potential robot for example? If you are counting spacecraft, assume one of each kind you are counting is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for this question, a robot does not necessarily need to be autonomous. A spacecraft remotely controlled could be a robot for this question for example. If something is officially robotic, it's a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further narrow it down, for this question a robot should have some mobility. It should be able to move or orient itself — or at least appendages or parts of itself — without someone (a human) grabbing it and moving it, or d be able to move/orient another substantial object in a complex manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science packages may have little gizmos that feed animals or mix, aliquot, or titrate liquids for example. If you know of some cool or prominent ones, count 'em!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine movement like pumps to periodically circulate fluids (e.g. water) or fans or magnetic pickups on old-style hard drives would not be robots for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't forget to count the ones that just plain look like robots!&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;Space is pretty expensive to get to, and there's a shocking lack of things in it. A planet made of gold sounds like a treasure worth the trip! How far would such a thing have to be away from Earth in order for it not to be economical to retrieve it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a fixed price for gold&lt;/li&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I just realized that your question does not specify to where the gold must be retrieved (sure, &quot;retrieve&quot; could mean to physically bring back to Earth, but it could also simply mean &quot;carry away and into [the people of] Earth's possession&quot;). One of the biggest advantages of space mining is for use of the resources &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; or elsewhere in space. Therefore, I am going to argue that from that perspective the only way that the distance of the gold matters is in whether or not we need to be that far out in the first place. If we have a reason to be out that far, then it is economical to mine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Little chips of water ice come off (the mountains) and get washed downstream, and then they get pushed up onto the beaches,&quot; Ray said. &quot;They get dried out and then they get picked up by the wind and blown into the deserts. And around the entire equator of Titan is nothing but dunes as far as the eye can see -- just like the dunes of the Arabian desert. But they're made out of little chips of water covered in hydrocarbon goo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article, Trina Ray is the Titan orbiter science co-chair at JPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the evidence that the dunes of Titan are made of &quot;water chips&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="186"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;It is modeled that the dunes must form from chips of Titan's bedrock. Whether those chips are primarily hydrocarbons or primarily water ice, depends on what Titan's crust is presumed to be composed of. There are varying models, depending on what is known of Titan (such as the moment of inertia), and one model with a reasonable level of support involves a substantial water ice crust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.D. Fortes explains in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0032063311001401/1-s2.0-S0032063311001401-main.pdf?_tid=762a73ba-720d-11e7-860e-00000aab0f6c&amp;amp;acdnat=1501078961_bde9892b02ae34225732d729acb7688f&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Titan’s internal structure and the evolutionary consequences&quot;&lt;/a&gt; that Titan's moment of inertia was estimated from measurements taken by Cassini of Titan's quadrupole gravity field. From these observations, an internal structure with a shell of water ice can be derived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question, there is no direct evidence that the dunes are made of water chips, rather what the dunes are made of is assumed based on what model of Titan's composition is considered most likely. Further, modeling the geological effects, depending on the assumed composition, may help to refine our understanding of Titan's dunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The release type determines who can have a NASA software code. If you meet the access criteria for the code (as defined below), NASA can transfer the software to you.
  Release types:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Public Release: For codes with a broad release and no nondisclosure or export control restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Open Source Release: For collaborative efforts in which programmers improve upon codes originally developed by NASA and share the changes&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Release Only: For codes available to U.S. persons only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. and Foreign Release: For codes that are available to U.S. persons and persons outside of the U.S. (who meet certain export control restrictions)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. Government Purpose Release: For codes that are to be used on behalf of the U.S. government by a federal agency or business/university under a federal contract/grant/agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis added&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. Person (EAR Part 772 and ITAR 120.15)
  Pursuant to the EAR and the ITAR, a U.S. Person includes :&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system and to bring back to Earth new knowledge and opportunities.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, perchlorate is actually rather unreactive under Martian surface conditions, and this actually explains the unusual abundance of perchlorate there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In any case, most of the chlorine has been oxidized as far as possible because the chlorine within perchlorate has a maximal +7 oxidation number. From a thermodynamic perspective, this makes perchlorate a strong oxidizing agent but kinetically, perchlorate is very inert at typical planetary surface temperatures. The energetically stable tetrahedral structure of oxygen atoms in perchlorate around the central, electrophilic chlorine atom renders perchlorate unreactive [Brown and Gu, 2006]. Hence, perchlorate, once formed, is prone to persist in soil provided that liquid water does not flush the perchlorate away, given that perchlorate salts are generally highly soluble. In contrast, if an environment is very wet, perchlorate is liable to be leached out of soil and end up diluted to trace concentrations in groundwater or rivers. In anaerobic conditions on Earth, the perchlorate is then microbially degraded back to chloride [Coates and Achenbach, 2004]. In short, perchlorate will accumulate in soil if its rate of deposition exceeds the rate of dissolution, and it will then persist if conditions remain free of perchlorate reduction. Thus, the oxidizing aridity of Mars, combined with perchlorate being an unreactive cul-de-sac of oxidation chemistry, probably explains the unusual abundance of perchlorate in Martian soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;h2&gt;It depends.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the industry, the concern with space junk is whether or not certain objects are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;navigational hazard&lt;/a&gt;. If the Falcon Heavy payload were on a collision course with an active spacecraft, then it would definitely be a navigational hazard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/elon-musk-on-the-roadster-to-mars&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;as it has no way to redirect itself&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the other answers, the issue of whether or not the payload can be considered &quot;defunct&quot; is more subjective, and in fact it is an issue that is unlikely to be resolved by some formal definition. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Derelict_satellites_orbiting_Earth&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Space junk&lt;/a&gt; is loosely defined for a reason. We talk about it from a collective perspective. Individual items simply aren't relevant until they are an active threat. That isn't to say that individual items aren't tracked--they are. That is part of the mitigation strategy for the broader issue.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The Arch Mission Foundation's Isaac Asimov &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; trilogy library aboard the Falcon Heavy payload stores the printed data of the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; series and a key to decode the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/j48oIm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/j48oIm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Arch disk&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the Arch Mission Foundation explains on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archmission.com/faq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that there are many different versions of the trilogy on the disk to help future discoverers to understand the information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Making the data decodable means making it possible for a recipient to actually understand what the data means. This means they have to understand the file format, and any markup or metadata, and the content as well - and this means they have to map it to their own mental model of the world. If they are humans and speak something related to an existing human language - this is not hard to do. But if they are not humans, or have nothing in common with us, then it is not an easy task!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One solution is to include one or more primers that teach how to understand the data formats, languages, formats and other encodings, of the data. To this end, we are including many different kinds of primers created by others as well as primers that may be created by the Arch Mission Foundation.
  But we also believe that, at least in the case of technologically advanced recipients, data mining and machine learning may be one of the main techniques that will be used to decode the content of the Arch Libraries.
  With that in mind we are working on designing the Arch Libraries to be helpful to future dataminers and AI algorithms. For example, we are including many different versions and translations of the same texts, side by side, with a lot of redundancy and other related information nearby to facilitate finding and understanding the patterns and relationships among concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; trilogy was chosen because it is emblematic for the Arch Mission Foundation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Asimov’s Foundation Series was the inspiration for the Arch Mission Foundation, many years ago when we first conceived of this project. It is a metaphor for what we hope this can become, and it is the perfect cornerstone as our mission begins.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this, we would also like to thank Asimov’s agent, Mel Berger, at WME Entertainment, for giving us permission to send this epic trilogy, to space, as an homage to Asimov’s brilliance and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar, Asimov’s Foundation Series is important for its symbolism. The series’ protagonist Hari Seldon endeavors to preserve and expand upon all human culture and knowledge through a 30,000 year period of turmoil. We felt this was a very fitting first payload to include in the Arch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arch Mission Foundation explains that this disk is also a test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first Arch Library is being deployed by SpaceX into a Mars orbit around the Sun for at least millions of years. We call this The Solar Library. It’s a small test library, using a new way of storing data in quartz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go on to explain that 360 terabytes is the &lt;em&gt;eventual&lt;/em&gt; capacity of the technology, so I am unsure what the current capacity is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This new medium, invented over decades by Dr. Peter Kazansky, is expected within 10 years to achieve a storage capacity of 360 Terabytes per 3.75 inch disk of quartz (that’s 7000 Blu-Ray Disks!)&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I cannot find a definitive answer to this one. Obviously, they open the windows sometimes to take pictures, but from what I can tell (from most pages that I have read) they actually keep the windows closed most of the time. This is because of the effect of the variable sunlight on their circadian rhythm. For example, this was Terry Virts's explanation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2017/10/9/q-a-with-astronaut-terry-virts&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Baltimore Magazine&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about sleeping in space?&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you get sunrise and sunset every hour and a half, unless you’re in high beta [orbit]. I went through a week with no sunsets. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s like living in Scandinavia in the summer or something?&lt;/strong&gt; Right or Antarctica in the winter. It’s just constant sunlight. So you close the windows and you don’t know what the sun is doing and you set your alarm to GMT [Greenwich Mean Time].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Interviewer's questions in bold, as in original.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be backed up by pages on astronaut nutrition (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/space_health/background/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lunar and Planetary Institute&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D Dilemma. Our skin uses small amounts of natural ultraviolet radiation to manufacture vitamin D, which — like calcium — is vital to maintaining healthy bones. About 10 minutes of Sun each day allows our skin to make the recommended amount of vitamin D. To work outside in the space environment, astronauts have to wear space suits which shield them from ultraviolet radiation. So because astronauts cannot produce vitamin D naturally from sun exposure, they take supplements to help with this issue. &lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes, during the geomagnetic storm of March 1989, NORAD lost track of thousands of objects:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During the great geomagnetic storm of 13-14 March 1989, tracking of thousands of space objects was lost and it took North American Defense Command (NORAD) many days to reacquire them in their new, lower, faster orbits. One LEO satellite lost over 30 kilometers of altitude, and hence significant lifetime, during this storm.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Yes, the 1C pathway has been successfully linked to ocular health of astronauts, and it seems Scott Smith is still involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study involving 49 space station astronauts established a definitive link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Scott] Smith says, “We found two genetic variances in the enzymes that facilitate the one carbon pathway.  This may help explain why some astronauts’ vision is affected but not others.” This represents the first time researchers have identified a genetic marker associated with a spaceflight medical issue. In fact this is also the first time that NASA has used human genetic data directly in an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another finding as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Smith continues, “We found that in addition to genetics, this effect was also associated with B vitamin status. [...]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the genetic link has been made, the precise cause is still unknown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Smith:] A missing piece of the puzzle, however, is while we have shown an association between genetics and vision; we still don’t know the mechanism - or cause - of these effects. That’s one of the keys to figuring out how to prevent or treat this in affected crewmembers.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Space-based solar power (SBSP) is potentially an option for Mars. It has been considered for Earth, but budgetary and geopolitical concerns have been an obstacle. Those concerns may be less relevant for the scale we are talking about at Mars. The advantage of SBSP at Mars is that (depending on number of collectors and orbital configuration) you can have constant power collection. You avoid the problem of dust. Power can be beamed to practically anywhere on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the budget could be justified and the technology is sound. The main area of difficulty presently is that the state of orbital manufacturing has not quite reached the point that would be best for this. For that matter, the optimal solution may be asteroid mining, which is still strictly conceptual (though a high-interest field).&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="3838"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Actually, then-NASA Administrator James Webb had already in March requested a budget to achieve a moon landing by the end of the decade. Kennedy's administration had declined to support this budget until Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth in April. The shock of this event forced Kennedy's hand, but there was some substantial planning that occurred prior to his announcement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firm evidence for Kennedy's essential unwillingness to commit to an aggressive space program came in March 1961 when the NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, submitted a request that greatly expanded his agency's fiscal year 1962 budget so as to permit a Moon landing before the end of the decade.&lt;/strong&gt; While the Apollo lunar landing program had existed as a longterm goal of NASA during the Eisenhower administration, Webb proposed greatly expanding and accelerating it. Kennedy's budget director, David E. Bell, objected to this large increase and debated Webb on the merits of an accelerated lunar landing program. In the end the president was unwilling to obligate the nation to a much bigger and more costly space program. &lt;strong&gt;Instead, in good political fashion, he approved a modest increase in the NASA budget to allow for development of the big launch vehicles that would eventually be required to support a Moon landing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A slow and deliberate pace might have remained the standard for the U.S. civil space effort had not two important events happened that forced Kennedy to act.&lt;/strong&gt; The Soviet Union's space effort counted coup on the United States one more time not long after the new president took office. &lt;strong&gt;On 12 April 1961 Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space with a one- orbit mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 1. The chance to place a human in space before the Soviets did so had now been lost.&lt;/strong&gt; The great success of that feat made the gregarious Gagarin a global hero, and he was an effective spokesman for the Soviet Union until his death in 1967 from an unfortunate aircraft accident. It was only a salve on an open wound, therefore, when Alan Shepard became the first American in space during a 15-minute suborbital flight on 5 May 1961 by riding a Redstone booster in his Freedom 7 Mercury spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Comparisons between the Soviet and American flights were inevitable afterwards. Gagarin had flown around the Earth; Shepard had been the cannonball shot from a gun. Gagarin's Vostok spacecraft had weighed 10,428 pounds; Freedom 7 weighed 2,100 pounds. Gagarin had been weightless for 89 minutes; Shepard for only 5 minutes. &quot;Even though the United States is still the strongest military power and leads in many aspects of the space race,&quot; wrote journalist Hanson Baldwin in the New York Times not long after Gagarin's flight, &quot;the world--impressed by the spectacular Soviet firsts--believes we lag militarily and technologically.&quot; By any unit of measure the U.S. had not demonstrated technical equality with the Soviet Union, and that fact worried national leaders because of what it would mean in the larger Cold War environment. &lt;strong&gt;These apparent disparities in technical competence had to be addressed, and Kennedy had to find a way to reestablish the nation's credibility as a technological leader before the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Close in the wake of the Gagarin achievement, the Kennedy Administration suffered another devastating blow in the Cold War that contributed to the sense that action had to be taken. Between 15 and 19 April 1961 the administration supported the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba designed to overthrow Castro. Executed by anti-Castro Cuban refugees armed and trained by the CIA, the invasion was a debacle almost from the beginning. It was predicated on an assumption that the Cuban people would rise up to welcome the invaders and when that proved to be false, the attack could not succeed. American backing of the invasion was a great embarrassment both to Kennedy personally and to his administration. It damaged U.S. relations with foreign nations enormously, and made the communist world look all the more invincible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While the Bay of Pigs invasion was never mentioned explicitly as a reason for stepping up U.S. efforts in space, the international situation certainly played a role as Kennedy scrambled to recover a measure of national dignity.&lt;/strong&gt; Wiesner reflected, &quot;I don't think anyone can measure it, but I'm sure it [the invasion] had an impact. I think the President felt some pressure to get something else in the foreground.&quot; T. Keith Glennan, NASA Administrator under Eisenhower, immediately linked the invasion and the Gagarin flight together as the seminal events leading to Kennedy's announcement of the Apollo decision. He confided in his diary that &quot;In the aftermath of that [Bay of Pigs] fiasco, and because of the successful orbiting of astronauts by the Soviet Union, it is my opinion that Mr. Kennedy asked for a reevaluation of the nation's space program.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two days after the Gagarin flight on 12 April, Kennedy discussed once again the possibility of a lunar landing program with Webb, but the NASA head's conservative estimates of a cost of more than \$20 billion for the project was too steep and Kennedy delayed making a decision. A week later, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Kennedy called Johnson, who headed the National Aeronautics and Space Council, to the White House to discuss strategy for catching up with the Soviets in space. Johnson agreed to take the matter up with the Space Council and to recommend a course of action.&lt;/strong&gt; It is likely that one of the explicit programs that Kennedy asked Johnson to consider was a lunar landing program, for the next day, 20 April 1961, he followed up with a memorandum to Johnson raising fundamental questions about the project. In particular, Kennedy asked&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do we have a chance of beating the Soviets by putting a laboratory in space, or by a trip around the moon, or by a rocket to go to the moon and back with a man? Is there any other space program that promises dramatic results in which we could win?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While he waited for the results of Johnson's investigation, this memo made it clear that Kennedy had a pretty good idea of what he wanted to do in space. &lt;strong&gt;He confided in a press conference on 21 April that he was leaning toward committing the nation to a large- scale project to land Americans on the Moon. &quot;If we can get to the moon before the Russians, then we should,&quot; he said, adding that he had asked his vice president to review options for the space program. This was the first and last time that Kennedy said anything in public about a lunar landing program until he officially unveiled the plan.&lt;/strong&gt; It is also clear that Kennedy approached the lunar landing effort essentially as a response to the competition between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. For Kennedy the Moon landing program, conducted in the tense Cold War environment of the early 1960s, was a strategic decision directed toward advancing the far-flung interests of the United States in the international arena. It aimed toward recapturing the prestige that the nation had lost as a result of Soviet successes and U.S. failures. It was, as political scientist John M. Logsdon has suggested, &quot;one of the last major political acts of the Cold War. The Moon Project was chosen to symbolize U.S. strength in the head-to-head global competition with the Soviet Union.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lyndon Johnson probably understood these circumstances very well, and for the next two weeks his Space Council diligently considered, among other possibilities, a lunar landing before the Soviets. As early as 22 April, NASA's Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden had responded to a request for information from the National Aeronautics and Space Council about a Moon program by writing that there was &quot;a chance for the U.S. to be the first to land a man on the moon and return him to earth if a determined national effort is made.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;He added that the earliest this feat could be accomplished was 1967, but that to do so would cost about \$33 billion dollars, a figure \$10 billion more than the whole projected NASA budget for the next ten years.&lt;/strong&gt; A week later Wernher von Braun, director of NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville, Alabama, and head of the big booster program needed for the lunar effort, responded to a similar request for information from Johnson. He told the vice president that &quot;we have a sporting chance of sending a 3-man crew around the moon ahead of the Soviets&quot; and &quot;an excellent chance of beating the Soviets to the first landing of a crew on the moon (including return capability, of course.)&quot; &lt;strong&gt;He added that &quot;with an all-out crash program&quot; the U.S. could achieve a landing by 1967 or 1968.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After gaining these technical opinions, Johnson began to poll political leaders for their sense of the propriety of committing the nation to an accelerated space program with Project Apollo as its centerpiece. He brought in Senators Robert Kerr (D-OK) and Styles Bridges (R-NH) and spoke with several Representatives to ascertain if they were willing to support an accelerated space program. While only a few were hesitant, Robert Kerr worked to allay their concerns. He called on James Webb, who had worked for his business conglomerate during the 1950s, to give him a straight answer about the project's feasibility. Kerr told his congressional colleagues that Webb was enthusiastic about the program and &quot;that if Jim Webb says we can a land a man on the moon and bring him safely home, then it can be done.&quot; This endorsement secured considerable political support for the lunar project. Johnson also met with several businessmen and representatives from the aerospace industry and other government agencies to ascertain the consensus of support for a new space initiative. Most of them also expressed support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Air Force General Bernard A. Schriever, commander of the Air Force Systems Command that developed new technologies, expressed the sentiment of many people by suggesting that an accelerated lunar landing effort &quot;would put a focus on our space program.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;He believed it was important for the U.S. to build international prestige and that the return was more than worth the price to be paid.&lt;/strong&gt; Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a member of the Space Council, was also a supporter of the initiative because of the Soviet Union's image in the world. He wrote to the Senate Space Committee a little later that &quot;We must respond to their conditions; otherwise we risk a basic misunderstanding on the part of the uncommitted countries, the Soviet Union, and possibly our allies concerning the direction in which power is moving and where long-term advantage lies.&quot; It was clear early in these deliberations that Johnson was in favor of an expanded space program in general and a maximum effort to land an astronaut on the Moon. Whenever he heard reservations Johnson used his forceful personality to persuade. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Now,&quot; he asked, &quot;would you rather have us be a second-rate nation or should we spend a little money?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an interim report to the president on 28 April 1961, Johnson concluded that &lt;strong&gt;&quot;The U.S. can, if it will, firm up its objectives and employ its resources with a reasonable chance of attaining world leadership in space during this decade,&quot; and recommended committing the nation to a lunar landing.&lt;/strong&gt; In this exercise Johnson had built, as Kennedy had wanted, a strong justification for undertaking Project Apollo but he had also moved on to develop a greater consensus for the objective among key government and business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson asked NASA to provide for him a set of specific recommendations on how a scientifically-viable Project Apollo, would be accomplished by the end of the decade. What emerged was a comprehensive space policy planning document that had the lunar landing as its centerpiece but that attached several ancillary funding items to enhance the program's scientific value and advance space exploration on a broad front&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spacecraft and boosters for the human flight to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific satellite probes to survey the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nuclear rocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satellites for global communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satellites for weather observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific projects for Apollo landings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Johnson accepted these recommendations and passed them to Kennedy who approved the overall plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last major area of concern was the timing for the Moon landing. The original NASA estimates had given a target date of 1967, but as the project became more crystallized agency leaders recommended not committing to such a strict deadline. James Webb, realizing the problems associated with meeting target dates based on NASA's experience in space flight, suggested that the president commit to a landing by the end of the decade, giving the agency another two years to solve any problems that might arise.&lt;/strong&gt; The White House accepted this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Kennedy unveiled the commitment to execute Project Apollo on 25 May 1961 in a speech on &quot;Urgent National Needs,&quot; billed as a second State of the Union message. He told Congress that the U.S. faced extraordinary challenges and needed to respond extraordinarily. In announcing the lunar landing commitment he said:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we are to win the battle that is going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, if we are to win the battle for men's minds, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. . . . We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then he added: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;I believe this Nation should commitment [sic] itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.&lt;/strong&gt; No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;There is no official universal time system for Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120717042540/http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/notes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has proposed an analog for Universal Time on Earth, that they refer to as Coordinated Mars Time, or MTC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The prime meridian of Mars is defined by the location of the crater Airy-0 (De Vaucoulers et al., 1973), named in honor of the British astronomer George Biddel Airy, who built the telescope at Greenwich whose location defines the prime meridian on Earth. Although it might be tempting to refer to &quot;standard&quot; time on the Mars prime meridian as &quot;Airy Mean Time&quot; (AMT) in analogy to Earth's &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; (GMT), the latter term has been supplanted by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in international timekeeping services. Mars24 therefore refers to the Mean Solar Time on the Mars prime meridian as Coordinated Mars Time, or MTC, by analogy to the terrestrial UTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system is referred to in the Wikipedia article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Coordinated_Mars_Time_(MTC)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Martian timekeeping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to split the International Space Station (ISS)? Absolutely. The ISS is entirely modular and can be broken down into individual components, but you propose to split the ISS along the US/Russian line and have two functional space stations. That is harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, the Russian Zvezda module contains the guidance, navigation, control, and propulsion capabilities of the ISS. Without Zvezda, a separated US station would be in trouble. The US does have the Interim Control Module which would take around two and a half years to complete and launch, assuming a Falcon could be retrofitted to launch it. However, this module was designed to be a temporary solution, and in the long term a more mature solution would need to be designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separated Russian station would be in slightly less trouble. Currently, the Russian segment depends on the US segment for supplemental power, but Russia has already prepared the Science Power Module, which is scheduled to arrive at the ISS in December 2019. The Russian segment also relies on the US segment for communications when not in line of sight of Russian ground stations, but this would not necessarily be a show stopper.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;In many ways, medaka fish were able to adapt to the microgravity environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Medaka fish were filmed for abnormal behaviors to consider a physiological change under microgravity. The movies showed that the fish became accustomed to life under microgravity by displaying unique behaviors such as upside-down, vertical, and tight-circle swimming. In addition, we found that the mating behavior at day 33 under microgravity was not different from that on the earth, indicating that the medaka fish had adapted to their microgravity environment.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Soyuz-2-1v, launched June 23, 2017, had a payload which attained orbit on the same day. The payload received the designation Kosmos-2519.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On August 23, 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that a miniature vehicle designed to inspect other satellites in orbit had been released from a military spacecraft launched two months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In its official registration to the United Nations, Russia reported that the satellite separating from Kosmos-2519 on Aug. 23, 2017, had received an official designation Kosmos-2521. Then, on October 30, 2017, Kosmos-2521 also released a sub-satellite, which was officially named &lt;strong&gt;Kosmos-2523&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis added&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the satellite that was deployed in October was Kosmos-2523. The satellite that was announced as an orbital inspector was Kosmos-2521, the satellite that Kosmos-2523 deployed &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt;. The official purpose of Kosmos-2523 is unknown. Perhaps that is the unusual behavior? A launch occurred and deployed a payload.

  &lt;p&gt;The data used by Dr. Li and his team was not new. It had been collected by NASA’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper, which hitched a ride on Chandrayaan 1, India’s first lunar probe, in 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The instrument was able to map most of the moon’s surface, but data from the permanent shadows — inside some of the craters near the poles — was a little bit patchy, and hard for researchers to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So Dr. Li and his team were creative, and patient. They peered into dark craters using traces of sunlight that had bounced off crater walls. They analyzed the spectral data to find places where three specific wavelengths of near-infrared light were absorbed, indicating ice water. They performed rigorous statistical analysis to make sure their results were uncorrupted by coincidental anomalies or instrument errors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ralph E. Milliken, a study author and an associate professor in the department of earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown University, said he “had a healthy dose of skepticism” when Dr. Li approached him with the idea of sifting through old data to look for clues in infrared. But he soon came around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectrolab is the company that made the panels for the Iridium NEXT satellites' solar arrays, so this should be pretty representative of the current state.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;First, they build the case for the positive detections to not be the result of noise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, ∼0.2% of shaded M (3) data showed positive detections (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). The average spectrum of positive detections of the random data (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) is distinct from those observed in the M (3) data (Fig. 1), indicating that a population of random noise of a size similar to that of the M (3) data is highly unlikely to produce ice-like spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, they conducted a null hypothesis test regarding what categories of absorption the pixels showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A null hypothesis test was conducted to show that the prediction of a third ice-like absorption based on detection of the other two is significant (SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the third ice-like absorption was always observed in the average spectra of the positive pixels (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). It is thus statistically significant to conclude that the three absorptions near 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0 μm occur simultaneously in a subset of the M (3) data, which is consistent with the presence of water ice in these pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the paper authors concluded &quot;direct and definitive evidence for surface-exposed water ice in the lunar polar regions&quot; in their &lt;em&gt;Significance&lt;/em&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, ice absorbs radar wavelengths. The absorptions detected were statistically meaningful--that is, the paper authors concluded that it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to be noise and &quot;definitive evidence&quot; of ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this on the chart at the end of the question, you look in the three ranges shown. Notice how there are peaks in those bands for pixels with no ice, but in the three moon readings shown there are troughs, as there are in the known ice reading from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In astronaut Clayton C. Anderson's book &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=ra4eCAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=The+Ordinary+Spaceman&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0wfKe67XdAhXR7VMKHbImAhkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=eagle&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ordinary Spaceman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he describes the following events revolving around Lani McCool, wife of astronaut &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_C._McCool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Willie McCool&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With everything set into motion, once the burn took place, [&lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt;] landing would be less than an hour away. That the process could not be reversed implied things must be looking very good from the perspective of the ground team, and they believed the weather was going to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lani still wasn't convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The drive continued, and I was thinking that my words may have helped Lani. She did seem more calm--at least until we passed a famous KSC landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Standing tall and straight above the low brush is a Norfolk pine that is home to a bald eagle's nest. Easily spotted by its massive size and conical shape, the nest is consistently a highlight of daily KSC tour buses. Viewers are encouraged to be on the lookout for the &quot;mama&quot; eagle, and much excitment ensues when she is spotted perched on her fortress. (KSC is a National Bird Sanctuary and home to a tremendous number of wildlife, none more majestic than our national symbol.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lani, knowing the story as well as anyone, was the first to note that the nest was empty. &lt;strong&gt;She also knew the tradition--to see the mama eagle seated proudly atop her nest on launch or landing day is a very good omen.&lt;/strong&gt; With the eagle not there, more uncertainty flooded into Lani's consciousness, further adding to her already high stress level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;emphasis added&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems your memory corresponds with Anderson's account pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;In former NASA Administrator Charles Bolden's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/591203main_11-0919_Bolde_Air_Space_Conference_final.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; at the Air Force Association Air &amp;amp; Space Conference and Tech Exposition in 2011, he explained a US military aerospace initiative, specifically the joint development of a practical hypersonic vehicle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The United States Air Force has been a key partner in many of
  NASA's aeronautics achievements over the decades. Right now
  the Air Force Research Laboratory is part of our X-48 research
  team. The X-48 is a blended wing body configuration – no tail
  and a wing that blends into the fuselage. It has the potential to
  achieve that ultimate goal I mentioned earlier -- dramatically
  reduce noise, emissions, and fuel use simultaneously.
  There's a 21-foot wingspan remotely piloted X-48 test vehicle out
  at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center that's completed a first
  round of test flights. It's been modified based on what we learned
  in those tests; round two of testing has just begun.
  At the hypersonic level, we're building a new legacy with the Air
  Force through development of the air-breathing scramjet
  propulsion technology. In 2004, flights of the X-43A uncooled
  13
  scramjet – each about ten seconds – broke speed records. One
  flight clocked in at Mach 9.6 or about 7,000 mph. For scramjets,
  though, it's as much about actual operation time as speed. In
  2010, the X-51A fuel-cooled scramjet achieved an operation time
  of nearly 150 seconds. Right now work continues on developing

  <row AnswerCount="5" Body="&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in what the main issues in space exploration today are from a professional's perspective. Similar to how the grand challenge issues of computational astrophysics were summarized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/grand-challenge-problems-in-computational-astrophysics/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in two bullet points, I would like a summarized view of the grand challenges in space exploration. My hope is that focusing on grand challenges from a professional perspective will keep this from being too opinion based. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Challenges&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; offers the following description of grand challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grand challenges are more than ordinary research questions or priorities, they are end results or outcomes that are global in scale; very difficult to accomplish, yet offer hope of being ultimately tractable; demand an extensive number of research projects across many technical and non-technical disciplines and accompanied by well-defined metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above, the subject area should be sufficiently small to keep this question manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="455"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;To give the desired global perspective, I surveyed grand challenges identified by NASA, Roscosmos, and ESA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Human presence in space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three identified areas of growth in terms of human missions. NASA listed &quot;Expand human presence in space&quot; as their number one theme for space technology grand challenges in 2010. Challenges included economical space access, space health and medicine, telepresence, and space colonization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roscosmos space strategy for 2010 and beyond included a new generation manned spacecraft for LEO and moon missions, a manned mission to Mars, and a new generation of manned space station for LEO. Manned space flight was assigned the lion's share of the budget, including a goal of manned lunar missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESA Space 4.0 Strategy included &quot;Exploitation of human-tended infrastructures&quot; in LEO and &quot;Extending human presence to the Moon and Mars&quot; as two of the their three common mission goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common focus areas: commercialization of space, mitigation of the impact of space on human health, and the creation of self-sustaining human environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Unmanned deep space missions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing in common with all was a focus on deep space. NASA's grand challenges of a space way station, efficient in-space transportation, high-mass planetary surface access, all access mobility, and surviving extreme space environments all serve as enablers to further unmanned deep space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roscosmos initially planned to send probes to a whole host of deep space destinations, but following a launch fiasco, revised plans to focus on unmanned lunar missions, with other deep space missions getting postponed. Missions to Mars and Venus are still eyed for the 2020s and 2030s, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESA's other common mission goal (besides the two mentioned above in section 1) is &quot;Returning samples from the Moon and Mars&quot;. Notably, this is a goal of NASA and Roscomos deep space exploration as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common focus areas: gateway stations, lander resiliency, deep-space telescopes, asteroid exploration, and of course Moon and Mars missions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap this back into overall challenges, what has been identified here is that the top focus will be on reducing cost of launch, supporting long-term human survival in space, and enabling a host of deep space missions to further planetary science, astronomy, and resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all these missions had to have their own power supply(and more). Why did NASA not send up a kind of energy hub that is fixed where multiple rovers can attach to and branch out from there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit would be that not all rovers need to bring their own power/solar panels but would just use a battery and could charge up at the hub. The drawback would of course be that they could all only explore a region around the hub. But since it seems that a lot of missions are at similar latitudes and I would assume similar latitudes bring similar possibilities to explore? Of course you would want one around the poles and one around the equator and maybe one in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has this been considered? Is it not useful because each location is so very unique and a different question could only be answered by this location that was selected? Or is it technically too difficult to maintain such a hub or &lt;strong&gt;what drawbacks are there that this was not done already&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

ViewCount="162"/>
  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Relying on a hub for power not only limits the area that rovers related to a single hub can cover, but it also adds an extra layer of complexity and risk to an already risky endeavor. Missions are designed mostly independently to optimize the chance of success. If a self-sufficient rover mission was one point of failure, then a rover that relies on a hub can be said to have two points of failure. If either the hub or the rover has an issue, it could jeopardize the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, since the power is centralized to a single hub, each mission adds to the potential losses incurred if the hub goes down. If you have 20 rovers sharing a single hub and the hub fails, then you just lost 20 missions instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, a hub strategy could make sense in a certain context. For example, if your goal was not scientific research but construction of a habitat, it might make sense to have several rovers that share a central hub. The rovers would operate over a smaller area, and you could have one or more rovers with the purpose of checking in on failed rovers (alluded to briefly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/exploration_rover_concepts_grc.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). You could even have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/972/58&quot;&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; that could fly overhead to see if a failed rover was in an unsafe condition for retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AcceptedAnswerId="32466" AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;To help frame the problem, I have written the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's December 19, 1972 and the Apollo 17 has returned to Earth, but something went wrong and they landed in the middle of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Outback&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, I happened to be nearby with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_(vehicle)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ute&lt;/a&gt; and some common (rural 1970s Australia) supplies. For some reason, NASA is not here. I don't know why, and I don't have a way to contact anyone because my bloody radio is &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/q/218294/46860&quot;&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;. The astronauts haven't opened the hatch yet, and I'm worried they may be hurt. Driving to get help might take too long. Without any prior knowledge of the capsule design, is there a way I can figure out to open the hatch just by looking at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fictional scenario is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/18392/did-early-russian-capsules-really-have-human-inside-labels/23659#comment99048_19293&quot;&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;h2&gt;If you carry the right Allen wrench, yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big golden arrow printed on the hatch that says &quot;RESCUE&quot;.  It points to a hole.  Around the hole are instructions for opening the hatch.  It even shows you which direction to turn!  (Source: &lt;em&gt;Apollo Program Summary Report&lt;/em&gt; page 4-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lP02a.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lP02a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apollo hatch&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details about the hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The exterior input is a socket in a recessed shaft, which penetrates the command module hatch and is rotated by a removable hand tool. It is used for ground operations, for checkout and test, for extravehicular activities, and for postlanding rescue. Because it is exposed to and must survive reentry heating, it is protected by a beryllium copper heat sink and is thermally insulated from the cabin interior by glass fabric spacers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ninfinger.org/models/vault2012/Apollo%20CM%20Hatch%20Design.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.ninfinger.org/models/vault2012/Apollo%20CM%20Hatch%20Design.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a 7/16 inch Allen (hex) wrench that is at least 4.25 inches long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The hatch also can be opened from the outside by a tool that is part of the crew's tool set and is carried by ground personnel. The tool is the emer­gency wrench, essentially a modified allenhead
  L-wrench. It is 6-1/4 inches long and has a 4-1/4-inch drive shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/CSM06_Command_Module_Overview_pp39-52.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/CSM06_Command_Module_Overview_pp39-52.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these tools had been stowed in the lunar module, but that won't help us now.  The 6.25 inch dimension appears to be enough to provide sufficient leverage, yet small enough to be stowed in the LM.  As long as you can get enough leverage, your tool doesn't need that.  The 4.25 inches is the depth of the hole; your tool could be longer.  The socket is 7/16 inch, but I suppose a slightly smaller metric tool could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-56860adb219fba08da80d2047e14bcf0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-56860adb219fba08da80d2047e14bcf0&quot; alt=&quot;emergency wrench&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crank away and the hatch will unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no idea how many pictures I found of actor Richard &lt;em&gt;Hatch&lt;/em&gt;, who played &lt;em&gt;Apollo&lt;/em&gt; on Battlestar Galactica!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I've cropped out the West solar panel array, which shows surprisingly tall vertical ridges that extend the full length of each of the ten segments where it joins adjacent segments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these related to the way the panel unfolds? Do they have a function now that the arrays are fully deployed? I would think they might tend to trap Martian dust blowing in the wind and interfere with any cleaning by subsequent wind or dust-devils, but maybe the effect is just the opposite?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I worry about is what @Uwe had mentioned in comments earlier; that blocking one &lt;s&gt;junction&lt;/s&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; cell in a group of series-connected &lt;s&gt;junctions&lt;/s&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; cells  causes a much larger current drop than you might estimate from the fraction of the total area covered. In some wiring configurations small shadows can become big problems and big losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; As pointed out in comments, these are triple-junction cells, so unlike the old silicon cells that had but one pn junction per cell, these have three, stacked directly on top of each other. &lt;a href=&quot;https://solaerotech.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://solaerotech.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;After separation from the SLA (by about 50-100 feet), the CSM &quot;turned around&quot; and docked with the LM to pull it out. This turning around was done by a 180 degree change in orientation. This could have been done by using the &quot;YAW&quot; or the &quot;PITCH&quot; function. I understand this was done by change in &quot;PITCH&quot; and not YAW. Is there any specific reason for using the PITCH function or it was left to crew?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Initially, I could not find a source for the selection of pitch over yaw, though I did note that the pilots preferred to start the pitch up manually before engaging autopilot, because autopilot would pick pitch up or down depending on what was shorter--the procedure was to pitch up. So it sounds like the pilots were pretty consistent about following the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[EDIT: Removed speculation.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Tristan's answer, I was able to track down the original explanation of the problem with a yaw maneuver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a vehicle that needed to refine its trajectory by fractions of a degree on the quarter-million-mile coast to the moon, the system worked exceptionally well, with one small exception. If the spacecraft inadvertently moved to a full right or full left yaw position, the gimbals had a nasty habit of lining up with one another and locking in that configuration, instantly wiping out whatever knowledge the computer had of the ship's attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Apollo 13&lt;/em&gt; by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more technical detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The third effect - that due to outer gimbal inertia - comes into play only with large middle gimbal angles away from the zero orientation shown in Figure 1. In the extreme, large middle gimbal angles cause an effect called &quot;gimbal lock&quot;. Gimbal lock occurs when the outer gimbal axis is carried around by vehicle motion to be parallel to the inner gimbal axis. At this trivial point the three gimbal axes lie in a single plane. No gimbal freedom now exists to &quot;unwind&quot; base motion about an axis normal to this plane. Even though any vehicle orientation with respect to the stable member can be accommodated by particular sets of the three gimbal angles the condition at gimbal lock prevents accommodation of a particular orientation change from the locked condition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transient loss of attitude due to gimbal lock effects, or any other disturbance, does not necessarily mean a permanent loss of orientation unless the gyro gimbal limit stops are reached. Within the integration range of the gyro the attitude is recovered as the gyro error is brought back to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Firm groundrules on how close to gimbal lock the Apollo IMU could operate satisfactorily depend upon experimental results with the actual flight configuration IMU. Within the last month these data have started to be collected using IMU #3 with breadboard electronics. It appears that gimbal lock can be approached as close as 10 degrees without risk and even much closer with some possibility of loss of stable member attitude. Stated more dramatically, the inner axis of the system was aligned within 10 degrees of a base motion axis perpendicular to the output axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;This test was performed to ensure that the 44 series of solar cells (or &quot;strings&quot;) were still connected. After the acoustic and vibration testing, there was a chance that some of the electrical connections could have been broken, so the test used a bar of purple lasers (a &quot;light bar&quot;) to verify that the strings were still functioning properly. A laser bar was used because it could test a single string at a time. Purple lasers happened to be on hand, and the solar cells function efficiently at that wavelength. Infrared lasers were also used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test is usually referred to as an illumination test, which is why it was not readily identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Luna 24 was launched on 9 August 1976, entered lunar orbit on 14 August 1976 and successfully landed on 18 August 1976. The lander deployed its sample drill and pushed its drilling head about 2 meters into the lunar soil. The sample was transferred to the small return capsule, and after nearly a day on the Moon, Luna 24 lifted off successfully on 19 August 1976. The return capsule entered Earth's atmosphere and parachuted safely to the ground on 22 August 1976. The probe returned 170.1 grams of lunar soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As in previous soil-return missions, telemetry relayed information to ground control on the performance of the drilling mechanism and the process of loading of the samples into the return vehicle. (393) Data showed that Luna-24's drill reached a depth of two meters under a 30-degree angle toward the local vertical, penetrating 225 centimeters deep into the soil. (398) As a result, a 260-centimeter flexible tube with a diameter of 12 millimeters was partially filled with lunar regolith. The tube was then coiled in a spiral-like fashion on a special drum with a diameter of 80 millimeters, which in turn, was sealed inside the metal storage container of the reentry capsule.&lt;/p&gt;

In this test, the ramjet was tested at altitudes ranging from 7000 to 41,500 feet and at ram-pressure ratios equivalent to free-stream Mach numbers as great as 1.84 using preheated 62-octane fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the report summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At an equivalent free-stream Mach number of 1.84 and a gas total-temperature ratio across the engine of 5.7, the equivalent sea-level net thrust was 8135 pounds. For these conditions, the over-all efficiency was 12.6 percent and the combustion efficiency was 70.3 percent. The corresponding net-thrust coefficient was 0.74. The investigation also showed that no change in the performance or operating range of the engine occurred when the fuel was changed from preheated 62-octane to preheated 100-octane gasoline. &lt;/p&gt;

There were lots of sources, even NASA &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45021817/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/nasa-wants-save-poop-moon-science/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331383682_A_Lunar_Microbial_Survival_Model_for_Predicting_the_Forward_Contamination_of_the_Moon&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt;, talking about the poop on the moon. However, I noticed that all of these sources were recent. None of them contemporary. When I started digging into what evidence was used for this claim, I found most people pointed to catalogs such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.nasa.gov/FINAL%20Catalogue%20of%20Manmade%20Material%20on%20the%20Moon.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which reference emesis bags. However, emesis is vomit, and while it is conceivable these bags may have been used for defecation, that is not definitive. They were supposed to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/5161hjpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;fecal collection bags&lt;/a&gt;. More critically, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/11/moon-puke-lunar-vomit.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;official source&lt;/a&gt; claims the emesis bags left were empty spares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As Russell mentions in the comments, these catalogs also have &quot;defecation collection device&quot; listed, but those may also be empty spares.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had a related question here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/32208/did-astronauts-on-the-moon-poop-in-front-of-each-other&quot;&gt;Did astronauts on the moon poop in front of each other?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this question it is discussed that defecation on the moon may not have occurred. However, it lacks a definitive answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there contemporary evidence for the claim that bags containing fecal matter were left on the moon? Or have any of the Apollo astronauts explicitly verified this claim since the Apollo program ended? If not, is it possible to indicate whether the claims are plausible or straight-up legend?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I believe used fecal bags from the LM were normally supposed to be transferred back to the CSM and returned with the crew to Earth for analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap15fj/18tunnel_leak_lm_jett.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Apollo 15 flight journal&lt;/a&gt;, in the annotation after 174:14:00, we have this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[As Apollo 15 disappears behind the Moon, Al switches on the Gamma-ray Spectrometer, X-ray Spectrometer and the Alpha Particle Spectrometer. The crew transfer all required items from the LM aided by a list in the Flight Plan that includes notes on where each item should be stored. The list includes film magazines, bagged rock and soil samples, core tubes including the very long deep core, food, used urine and fecal bags, and one of the OPS packages from the surface.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That annotation was added after the fact, but in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/24_Day9_Pt1.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Apollo 16 flight journal&lt;/a&gt;, at 191:19:09, while preparing to close out the LM for jettison, CAPCOM Haise gives the crew a checklist of items to transfer to the CSM: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;191 19 09 Haise: Okay. Another little block you might write out to the left there, label it &quot;Transfer Items.&quot; And, maybe you've already done some of these, but this will take care of some of the ones we missed having you do yesterday. And they're the PTK(?) [PPK], the Flight Kit, the purse with the unused food, and the used fecal-urine bags, and lastly the DSEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't speak directly to the earlier flights, but given that the used bags on the CSM were retained for analysis from day one, I think this would have been the procedure for all the moon landings. It also doesn't even prove fecal bags were &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; in the LM on Apollo 16; Haise almost certainly meant &quot;if any were used, transfer them, and please don't tell me about it&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't swear Aldrin didn't toss a used diaper onto the moon, but I am strongly leaning towards &quot;Myth: Busted&quot; here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the earlier flights involved shorter lunar stays, &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/32208/did-astronauts-on-the-moon-poop-in-front-of-each-other?noredirect=1&amp;amp;lq=1&quot;&gt;it's less likely that fecal bags were used at all&lt;/a&gt;; having to do one's business in the cramped LM cabin next to your crewmate would not have been pleasant. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenoxylate&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lomotil&lt;/a&gt; and willpower can get you through two days pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; The only source found so far is an article that claims that Charlie Duke claims to have left urine on the Moon. No definitive report about fecal matter on the Moon, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, it's claimed by several sources (probably all copying one article) that 96 bags of poop, urine and puke were left on its surface. By my own count from NASA's list (see below), there were at least 32 body fluid bags left on the Moon. Whether any of the bags left on the Moon contained fecal matter is hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the poop bags wasn't a nice experience, as Micheal Collins wrote in &lt;em&gt;Carrying the fire&lt;/em&gt;: after defecation you had to add a small bag with some chemicals and then knead the whole thing to kill of the bacteria (this was done to all poop bags, as far as I know, not only those left on the moon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/3/22/18236125/apollo-moon-poop-mars-science&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;article at Vox.com about this and what we could learn from collecting those bags&lt;/a&gt;. The article claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke spent 71 hours on the moon in 1972. On a recent phone call, he confirmed that the crew left human waste behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We did,” he says. “We left urine that was collected in a tank ... and I believe we had a couple of bowel movements — but I’m not sure — those were in a trash bag. We had a couple of bags of trash we kicked out on the lunar surface.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/1113227302211551233&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Buzz Aldrin wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, I sure feel bad for whoever finds my bag &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is no definitive statement that his bags did contain fecal matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the NASA &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.nasa.gov/FINAL%20Catalogue%20of%20Manmade%20Material%20on%20the%20Moon.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Catalogue of Manmade Material on the Moon&lt;/a&gt; which, for Apollo 11, lists four &lt;em&gt;Defecation Collection Devices&lt;/em&gt;. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690023882.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;review of spacecraft waste-management systems&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes apparent that this is official name for the poop bags. Since this list is very detailed, there probably exist reports for each mission listing these items. It does not list whether these were used or unused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s6ch2.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;SP-368 Biomedical Results of Apollo&lt;/a&gt; does list details of samples returned from the missions (there are… interesting tables in there) but doesn't say anything about matter left on the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting document is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/documents/NASA%20TN-D-6737.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Apollo Experience Report - Crew Provisions And Equipment Subsystem&lt;/a&gt;. It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lunar module waste-management system. - &lt;strong&gt;To prevent contamination on the lunar surface&lt;/strong&gt;, the LM waste-management system uses a pressure-operated urine-collection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Emphasize mine.) This may be an indicator that the bags left on the Moon were (supposed to be) empty.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;h2&gt;If any of the 12 had a bowel movement and then obeyed procedures, then yes there is poop on the moon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 30+ hour search of Apollo documentation did not reveal a direct answer either way.  Perhaps the reason why NASA has never given a direct answer is because &quot;leave poop on the moon&quot; is not good public relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, multiple sources indicate detailed planning and procedures to &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt; feces on the moon.  There is a notable absence of planning, procedures, or records of &lt;em&gt;transfer&lt;/em&gt; of feces from the lunar module to the command module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecal management in the command module was very different from management in the lunar module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feces in the CM was intended to be brought back to Earth.  The production of feces does not change the total mass of the CM, so there is no &lt;em&gt;flight penalty&lt;/em&gt; in retaining it.  In fact, jettisoning feces would make it harder to track the total mass of the CM.  Furthermore, the fecal matter can be studied for medical purposes if brought back to Earth.  So the CM had a special compartment to store feces.  It even had a special ventilation system, with a backup in case that failed (see NASA Tech Note &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/tnD6737CrewProvisnsEquip.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;D-6737&lt;/a&gt;, p. 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a flight penalty for leaving the moon with feces.  It was extra weight, which would need more fuel or allow for less moon rocks to take back.  Nor did the LM have a ventilation system for the waste compartment, which saved even more weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There were two types of fecal devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fecal Containment System&lt;/em&gt; (aka FCS) was an adult diaper.  It was used when the astronauts were in their spacesuits (e.g., launch, moonwalks, and re-entry).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fecal Collection Assembly&lt;/em&gt; (aka FCA) was a kit.  It comprised an outer bag, an inner bag which attached to the buttocks, a germicidal pouch, toilet tissue, and some wet-wipes.  To complicate things, in the LM it was called the Defecation Collection Device (DCD), but it's the same thing.  Various sources sometimes called the inner or outer bags of this kit a &quot;fecal/emesis bag&quot; or &quot;F/E bag&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did anyone poop while they were on the moon?&lt;/strong&gt;  I can't tell.  There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s6ch2.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of every fecal sample returned by Apollo.  Some entries label which astronaut did it, but other entries are unlabeled.  Worse, no sample is labeled for &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; it was taken.  So this list tells us nothing about pooping on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astronauts were not asked to record their bowel history, nor is it discussed in the mission reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have raised the point that astronauts avoided pooping.  It was an unpleasant process, and many astronauts avoided it as much as they could.  Also, they were given low-residue diets to reduce bowel movements.  I recently saw an interview with an Apollo astronaut who said that he didn't go the entire trip, and when he got on the recovery aircraft carrier, he wanted to go poop instead of waste time shaking the admiral's hand.  It's certainly plausible for the early (7-14) missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Apollo 15-17 spent several days on the lunar surface, and the astronauts were asked to eat more because of weight loss on prior missions.  So I'm skeptical that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the 12 astronauts avoided pooping while on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did they collect the feces?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/LM10HandbookVol1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;LM Operations Handbook vol 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, section 2.11.4.3.2 describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To defecate , the astronaut removes the inner bag from the outer bag. After unfastening the PGA and removing undergarments, the wax tissue is peeled off the bag's inner surface and the bag is placed securely over the anal area.   After   defecating, the used toilet tissue is deposited in the used bag and the disinfectant package is pinched and broken inside the bag.  The used bag is then closed, kneaded, and inserted in the outer bag.    The wax paper is removed from the adhesive on the fecal/emesis bag, it is sealed, then &lt;strong&gt;placed in the waste disposal compartment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, compare that wording to section 2.11.4.2 of the same document, which describes disposing food waste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A germicide tablet, attached to the outside of the food bag, is inserted into the bag after food consumption, to prevent fermentation and gas formation.  The bag is rolled to its smallest size, banded, and &lt;strong&gt;placed in the waste disposal compart­ment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So food wrappers -- which were definitely not brought back for study -- are placed in the same waste compartment as feces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disposing of feces was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/LM11HandbookVol2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;official procedure&lt;/a&gt; that they were expected to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;4.13.7.6 Defecation Disposal
1.  Remove defecation device from stowage.
2.  Insert inner bag into unit.
3.  Open germicide pouch &amp;amp; insert into inner F/E bag.
4.  Perform task.
5.  Seal inner bag.
6.  Place inner bag into outer F/E bag &amp;amp; seal outer bag.
7.  Knead contents.
8.  Stow bag.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the waste container jettisoned?&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/a17lsp.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Procedures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, p. 245:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;11. Jettisoned to Lunar Surface Prior to L/O
2 ICG
2 Hammocks
Sleep Restraint
**Waste Receptacle**
Helmet/EVA Int. Stow. 
ETB
2 LCGAdapters
1 LM ECS LiOH cartridge and Cannister
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But couldn't the feces be taken out of the waste receptacle before jettison?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/surface17.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;not on the checklists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where would you place it in the LM?  There's no entry for it in the LM stowage documentation, other than the waste receptacle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But couldn't it have been transferred to the CM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a person back in mission control whose job was to track what items were in each spacecraft.  They even used computers to help them with inventory.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/alsj-stowage.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Every mission&lt;/a&gt; has a printout of this inventory.  Each mission has hundreds of entries, no matter how small or mundane (like watch wristbands).  There are six lists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.  Command module at launch.  Apollo 17 had 3 FCS (diapers) stowed, 1 FCS on crew, 48 FCA stowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.  Lunar module at launch.  No fecal devices listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.  Items transferred from the CM to the LM, before descent to the moon.  Apollo 17 had 2 diapers on crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.  Items in the LM at ascent from the moon.  Apollo 17 had 2 diapers on crew and 12 DCD kits with the note &quot;offload used item&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.  Items transferred from the LM to the CM.  Apollo 17 had the 2 diapers worn by the crew which were &quot;offloaded prior to separation&quot;.  &lt;strong&gt;No other fecal devices are documented in the transfer to the CM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F.  CM at Earth re-entry.  Apollo 17 lists 36 FCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a transfer to the CM was not documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Probably yes.&lt;/strong&gt;  It is likely at least one astronaut pooped while on the moon, and the official procedures were to leave it on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This answer is based on a source from 2001. It provides a lot of background as a historical overview, but it does not take into account recent changes in the program. Please review the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/38452/58&quot;&gt;Organic Marble's answer&lt;/a&gt; for a fuller perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, it began as a temporary program. In the late 1950s, the US military needed accurate and timely forecasts in order to plan times for cloud-free observation of Soviet targets with photoreconnaissance satellites. When a study of the subject completed in 1961, NASA was instructed to develop meteorological satellites for all civil and military forecasting needs, but the Pentagon remained unconvinced that the NASA program would meet the needs of the National Reconnaissance Program (NRP). They believed the NASA plans would not meet their requirements for secrecy and that the limited coverage they would provide would be insufficient. In July 1961, the first director of the DMSP was appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1969, all three military services had begun to rely on the DMSP, and sought weather support on a daily basis. The satellites by this point met tactical support requirements and so was of utility for more than one purpose for the military. The program intended to be temporary had become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-1980, though the NOAA satellites often provided better service, the combined data from NOAA and DMSP sources aided forecasting. In 1993, it was decided that the efforts be combined, and NOAA would hold overall responsibility for the joint system. In 1998, NOAA assumed responsibility for controlling the DMSP satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;As many of us know, the mission operations software of NASA has changed significantly over time. Needs have changed with the space program and mission operations software has adapted to keep up with these demands as well as the current state of the industry. However, mission operations software is not a monolith. It is composed of many different parts, and they need not all change at the same pace. If it ain't broke...well, you know the saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, what is the oldest software architecture in use in mission operations today? What is the newest (will accept deployed and high potential to-be-deployed)? Are there any trends in architectural changes over the last 20-30 years?&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;The biggest single change in the Houston Mission Control Center (MCC) occurred in the late 1990s.  This was the change from a mainframe based system architecture to a workstation based system with a client/server architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switchover was gradual with the new system first being used in a following mode, then gradually assuming control function-by-function.

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;I had the distinct honor of working for John Muratore on two distinct projects. One was the X-38. But before that, I worked on developing advanced software for his Real Time Data System project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RTDS project started in 1986 when Muratore saw the archaic structure of Mission Control. The primary goal of the project was to transition from a single mainframe computer that drove dumb terminal displays at Mission Control consoles to a distributed system comprising many minicomputers and data servers, each of which ran their own sets of software, that displayed data to users on non-dumb terminals, and that published data to / subscribed data from other applications. The project took off in part because it had the explicit backing of Eugene Kranz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge was the completely fractured nature of computing at that time. Organic Marble's answer has a graphic that claimed &quot;RTDS will run on almost any UNIX workstation&quot;. That made me chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the age of the minicomputer. Nothing was standardized. UNIX had not yet been standardized. The UNIX library calls never were the same from one vendor to the next. The C programming language had not yet been standardized. Every vendor provided its own compiler that had its own interpretation of what C was, and had its own library of standard functions that were anything but standard. The manner in which computers stored and transmitted data had not been standardized. Consider the 32 bit hexadecimal number 0x12345678. Some computers would store this just like that (little endian). Others, would store that number as if it were 0x87654321 (big endian). Yet others, as if it were 0x78563412 (mixed endian). Back then one had to expect every random order when switching to a different computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason RTDS &quot;ran on almost any UNIX workstation&quot; was because John continuously wrangled with vendors to supply the project with &quot;free&quot; computers for short trial periods. We had to be agile well before the concept was known elsewhere. But this also made our code get bloated with &lt;code&gt;#if defined computer_X do_this #elif defined computer_Y do_that ...&lt;/code&gt; constructs because every computer was different back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My contribution to the project was in the form of AI software than did not use expert systems. I had been charged with identifying opportunities for using AI in Mission Control, but they didn't need me to recommend expert systems. NASA already knew about that. I focused on signal processing and pattern recognition. One system identified what electrical devices had been turned on or off based on transient signatures. My software could easily detect when the cabin fan properly turned on or off, when someone had flushed the properly functioning toilet, when someone powered up the properly functioning vacuum cleaner, or turned on or off a properly functioning scientific experiment. But it had less success if the equipment was malfunctioning. So that was a failed idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did have one key success. Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) missions used a Rube Goldberg device called the Regenerative CO2 Removal System to remove carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere. The device went through a ridiculously complex sequence of operations that over the course of time accumulated carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and later vented that CO2 to vacuum. There was a chance of a very bad failure at several key points in this ridiculously complex sequence of operations where cabin atmosphere instead of accumulated CO2 could have been vented to vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RCRS had built-in failure detection software that looked for these failure modes. In the case that anything suspect happened, the RCRS placed all of its valves in safe mode, and then erased all of its memory. If the machine did shut itself down, there was no way to query the machine regarding why it did so. With multiple failure points, diagnosing why the machine had shut itself down would have been challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine did not send internal state information, but it did send sensor readings. I was tasked with writing a pattern recognition application that made sense of these limited data. My app ran silently for several EDO flights. Years later, in 1998 (STS-90), it pinged loudly, a few seconds before the machine shut itself down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My application saved Mission Controllers eight hours of diagnosis time. My application most certainly did not suggest the brilliant solution they came up with. It simply told them &quot;the device failed HERE&quot;. They quickly verified that that diagnosis was correct. And then they went to work coming up with a way around the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &quot;Shuttle Flight Data File&quot; included, amongst other non-booklike things, multiple rolls of duct tape. The arrived-at solution used that duct tape.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row AnswerCount="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JunoCam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;article on JunoCam&lt;/a&gt; (and I have seen other corroborating sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JunoCam is not one of the probe's core scientific instruments; it was put on board primarily for public science and outreach, to increase public engagement, and to make all images available on NASA's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article does go on to say essentially that researchers will get what science they can out of the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the images look quite good. What are some things about the camera that make it less valuable for science than earlier cameras that &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; among the core scientific instruments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible answers might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images at fewer frequencies (Is that true? What particularly desirable frequencies are missing?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less suitable lens or lenses (Again, is this true? If so, in what way?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information about what you can't tell about Jupiter because of the weaknesses would be good too.&lt;/li&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;p&gt;Since there's still not an answer yet, I thought I'd offer a partial answer by addressing one of your suggested areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What particularly desirable frequencies are missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine what is &quot;desirable&quot;, let's compare to another Jupiter orbiter: &lt;em&gt;Galileo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Galileo&lt;/em&gt; also had a CCD, the Solid-State Imager (SSI), which operated in the spectral range of 350-1100 nm. This means that it could capture some near-ultraviolet (completely out of range for Junocam) and more of near-infrared (Junocam stops at 900 nm). However, as SSI lacked a filter for the near-ultraviolet range, I doubt that specific capacity gave it much of a science advantage over Junocam. On the other hand, SSI did have multiple filters in the near-infrared range, and the filter at 986 nm provided it the capacity to capture electronic absorption features near 1000 nm, as in the reflection spectra of iron-bearing minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would the capacity for Junocam to capture imaging in that range be of science value? I'm not qualified to say, but it seems plausible to me that if Junocam had this capacity some additional science could be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rover was deployed the evening of July 5, 1997, and its last transmission was received via &lt;em&gt;Pathfinder&lt;/em&gt; at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was planned to be a 90-sol (about 92 days) mission, but ended up having a life span of 2269 days. After 1944 days it ceased to be mobile after it got stuck in soft sand, but it continued to do science as a stationary platform. Whichever way you look at it, it lasted over 20 times its designed life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; landed on Mars at 4:35 UTC (Earth-received time) on January 4, 2004. It got stuck in the sand on May 1, 2009, and then sent its last transmission March 22, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; landed on Mars on January 25, 2004 at 5:05 UTC spacecraft local time. It sent its last transmission June 10, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

Its primary mission ended after 668 sols (687 days), but it has continued to operate for a total lifetime of 2597 days so far. It has already survived 3 times its designed life, and since its mission was extended indefinitely it may continue to operate for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt; landed on Mars on August 6, 2012 at 5:17 UTC spacecraft local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, the top lifespan is currently held by &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; at 5250 days, and &lt;em&gt;Sojourner&lt;/em&gt; had the lowest lifespan at 83 days. However, even &lt;em&gt;Sojourner&lt;/em&gt; exceeded its designed lifespan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: There were at least 9 years and 6 months of continuous plant growth on the ISS, so the answer is yes if you accept a +/- 6 month margin of error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first plant growth experiment hosted on the ISS was ADVASC, or Advanced Astroculture, which boarded the station on April 21, 2001 during Expedition 2. No later than May 6, 2001, the growth was started in ADVASC. The plant grown was &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt;, a species of mustard plant, and 90% germinated in space, with 70% reaching maturity. Over two months of growth, the plants grew their own seeds, some of which were later replanted on the station and grew to maturity (forming their own seeds), as well. At the end of the two month period, the growth chamber was returned to the ground, but since some seeds were retained on the ISS it meets your qualification of living plants being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second growth chamber was sent up December 5, 2001, during Expedition 4. In addition to planting the seeds from the previous experiment (as already mentioned), new seeds of another species of &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; were delivered as well. 65% of these wild &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; seeds were grown. Some of these plants stayed on the ISS until April 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 8, 2002, another plant growth experiment was launched, the Biomass Production System (BPS). &lt;em&gt;Brassica rapa&lt;/em&gt; (field mustard) and &lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt; (dwarf wheat) were part of two experiments conducted in this system. Their growth was started on the ground, and the plant ages at launch were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;3 days of age (Chamber 1), 11days of age (Chamber 2), 5 days of age (Chamber 3), and 4 days of age (Chamber 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test lasted 73 days, and during this experiment additional sets of plants were germinated and grown. This means continuous plant growth lasted until late June 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the end of this experiment, the third ADVASC experiment boarded the station on June 7, 2002. For this experiment, Pioneer brand 9306 soybean seeds were planted before flight. They grew from seed to seed over the course of about 70 days, and it wasn't flown back down until October 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lada vegetation chamber was launched September 25, 2002. From its deployment until September 2010, Lada sustained continuous plant growth on the ISS, and it is still in service providing almost continuous growth over the lifetime of the ISS on its own! Lada has grown many plants including mizuna, tomatoes, peas, radishes, peppers, and rice. ISS astronauts have been able to eat some of the harvests from Lada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 7, 2002, the Plant Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (PGBA) was launched and delivered to the ISS. This experiment also grew &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; (identified here as thale cress). The experiment flew back December 2002. Apparently, the experiment was considered a failure because they did not get the expected results, but the public information does not clarify whether the plants did not survive or just failed to meet the growth targets. The goal of the experiment was to maximize growth, and the results say they &quot;did not develop in a normal manner&quot;, which doesn't sound like plant death to me. However, since they started as seeds, we can't be sure whether they germinated at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were likely other plant experiments in between 2002 and 2010, but for the sake of brevity I'm going to jump ahead to 2010 where the continuity established by Lada leaves off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 19, 2010, the HydroTropi experiment began to observe the root growth of cucumber seeds. It concluded on October 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot find another plant experiment until several months into 2011, so this may be where the continuity breaks. That comes out to about 9 years and 6 months of continuous plant growth, which is just short of a decade. However, the original article title does say &quot;in space&quot;, not just on the ISS. So if you consider the fact that Mir hosted a greenhouse in 2000, then (if allowing for the brief interruption of transition from Mir to ISS) it does come out looking pretty close to a decade of continuous plant growth in space. And that's about six years before the article in question!&lt;/p&gt;
